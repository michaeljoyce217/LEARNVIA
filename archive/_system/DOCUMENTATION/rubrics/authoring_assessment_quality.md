# Assessment Quality Rubric

## Overview
This rubric evaluates the effectiveness of assessment strategies, ensuring they accurately measure learning objectives and provide meaningful feedback for improvement.

## Scoring Scale
- **4 - Exemplary**: Sophisticated assessment design that enhances learning
- **3 - Proficient**: Well-designed assessments aligned with objectives
- **2 - Developing**: Basic assessment present but with limitations
- **1 - Inadequate**: Poor or misaligned assessment strategies

- No explanations for answers
- No improvement guidance
- Unhelpful or confusing feedback

### 4. Authentic Application (25%)

#### Exemplary (4)
- Real-world scenarios and applications throughout
- Performance-based assessments included
- Transfer of learning clearly evaluated
- Creative problem-solving required

#### Proficient (3)
- Good use of realistic scenarios
- Some performance assessment
- Transfer generally evaluated
- Some creative application

#### Developing (2)
- Limited real-world connection
- Mostly traditional assessment
- Minimal transfer evaluation
- Little creative application

#### Inadequate (1)
- No authentic application
- Only rote memorization tested
- No transfer evaluation
- No creative thinking required

## Implementation Guidelines

### Assessment Process
1. Map all assessments to learning objectives
2. Review question clarity and design
3. Evaluate feedback quality and timeliness
4. Assess authenticity and application
5. Calculate weighted score

### Common Issues to Address
- **Assessment-objective mismatch**: Testing different skills than taught
- **Ambiguous questions**: Multiple valid interpretations possible
- **Trivial assessment**: Testing memorization instead of understanding
- **Missing feedback**: No learning opportunity from assessment

### Improvement Recommendations
- Use Bloom's Taxonomy to ensure appropriate cognitive levels
- Implement rubrics for complex assessments
- Provide worked examples for incorrect responses
- Include self-assessment opportunities

## Assessment Design Framework

### Formative Assessment Strategies
- [ ] Entry tickets (prior knowledge check)
- [ ] Exit tickets (lesson comprehension)
- [ ] Peer assessment activities
- [ ] Self-reflection prompts
- [ ] Quick polls and checks

### Summative Assessment Types
- [ ] Traditional tests (multiple choice, short answer)
- [ ] Performance tasks
- [ ] Projects and portfolios
- [ ] Presentations
- [ ] Case study analysis

### Feedback Components
- [ ] Correctness indicator
- [ ] Explanation of correct answer
- [ ] Common error discussion
- [ ] Next steps for improvement
- [ ] Resources for review

## Quality Indicators Checklist

### Validity Measures
- [ ] Content validity (covers curriculum)
- [ ] Construct validity (measures intended skills)
- [ ] Criterion validity (predicts performance)
- [ ] Face validity (appears appropriate)

### Reliability Factors
- [ ] Consistent scoring criteria
- [ ] Clear rubrics provided
- [ ] Minimal ambiguity
- [ ] Appropriate time allocation

## Scoring Matrix

| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-4) | Weighted Score |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Alignment with Objectives | 25% | | |
| Question Design Quality | 25% | | |
| Feedback Mechanisms | 25% | | |
| Authentic Application | 25% | | |
