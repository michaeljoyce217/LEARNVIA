# Learnvia Style Guide - AI Reviewer Prompt

## CRITICAL MECHANICAL RULES (HIGH SEVERITY)

### Contractions - NEVER ALLOWED
**Rule**: Do not use contractions in instructional text. Spell out full expression.
- BAD: "What's the best way..." / "Let's examine..."
- GOOD: "What is the best way..." / "The next example..."
- **EXCEPTION**: Possessives ARE necessary and preferred
  - GOOD: "the square's area"
  - BAD: "the area of the square"

### Imperative Voice - RESTRICTED USE
**FORBIDDEN** in general instruction:
- BAD: "Find the equation. State the equation in slope-intercept form"
- GOOD: "The equation of the graph in slope-intercept form is _____"

**ALLOWED ONLY** in:
- Teaching techniques/procedures
- Embedded questions
- Follow-up questions
- Homework questions

### Pronouns - RESTRICTED
- **Do NOT use**: you, she, he, they, or it
- **Minimal use**: "we" (only when truly referring to ourselves as people)
- **Example**: "We read f' aloud as f prime" (acceptable)
- **Avoid**: "We define slope as..." (use "Slope is defined as...")

## WRITING MECHANICS

### Contractions vs Possessives
- NO contractions: don't → do not, what's → what is
- YES possessives: function's derivative, square's area

### Vague References
**Do NOT use "it" or "they"**:
- BAD: "The expression has one term. It uses two variables" (it could refer to expression or term)
- GOOD: "The term uses two variables"
- **Exceptions**: Sometimes yields simplicity without ambiguity
  - "A function and its inverse..." (obviously refers to function)
  - "Gastroenteritis is common. Its symptoms include..." (not vague, not plural)

**Avoid "This is..." / "This means..." / "This" as subject**:
- BAD: "This qualifies as a simple expression"
- GOOD: "An expression with one term qualifies as a simple expression"

### Sentence Structure
- **Subject-verb-object** construction preferred
- **Avoid introductory clauses**:
  - BAD: "While we can approximate the area using rectangles, the difference..."
  - GOOD: "We can approximate the area using rectangles. However, the difference..."
- **No lazy starts** ("There is/are"):
  - BAD: "There is a horizontal asymptote"
  - GOOD: "The graph of f has a horizontal asymptote at y = 0"
- **8th grade reading level** target

### Word Choice
- Use "so" instead of thus/hence/therefore

## SEVERITY INDICATORS

### HIGH SEVERITY (Must Fix):

- Imperative voice in general instruction (not in techniques/questions)
- Personal pronouns (you, it, they in vague references)
- Missing LaTeX for numerals/math
- Incorrect LaTeX punctuation (outside instead of inside)
- Missing space in coordinates
- Mixed numbers instead of improper fractions
- Beginning sentences with mathematical symbols
- Directional language (below/above/left/right)

### MEDIUM SEVERITY (Should Fix):
- Missing serial comma
- Using e.g./i.e. instead of Ex:/specifically
- "There is/are" lazy starts
- Pop culture/colloquial references
- Non-parallel structure
- Missing units in tables/headings
- Inconsistent terminology (synonyms)

### LOW SEVERITY (Polish):
- Excessive use of "we"
- Could use more concise phrasing
