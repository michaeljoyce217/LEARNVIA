# Learnvia Product Vision - AI Context Version

## CORE MISSION
Serve non-traditional learners who struggle with traditional math education, particularly students from underserved communities with fewer opportunities to build strong foundations.

## TARGET STUDENT PROFILE (USE FOR ALL EVALUATIONS)
- Studying home alone
- Low confidence in math
- Scared of failing
- Limited time availability
- May do substantial coursework on mobile devices
- Different from well-supported, motivated students

## CONTENT PHILOSOPHY

### Bite-Sized Learning (Chunking)
- Lessons: 5-10 minute activities
- Modules: ~50 minutes total
- Activities: ~10 minutes each
- Designed for interrupted study sessions

### Progressive Building (Scaffolding)
- Start simple, build slowly
- No big conceptual jumps
- Each step prepares for next
- Extensive support at each level

### Purpose-Driven (Alignment)
- Backwards design approach
- Lessons → Homework → Quizzes → Exams
- Every element serves learning outcomes
- No tangential content

## KEY PRINCIPLES FOR REVIEW

### Obsessive Conciseness
"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage - to move in the opposite direction." --Einstein
- Remove rather than add
- Simplest possible explanations
- Minimal cognitive load

### Mobile-First Design
- Content must work on small screens
- Avoid elements that break on mobile
- Consider vertical viewing
- No complex layouts requiring rotation

### Support Not Gatekeeping
- Built-in help via AI tutor
- Multiple attempts allowed
- Hints and scaffolding provided
- Focus on learning, not filtering

### Accessibility Priority
- 8th grade reading level
- Clear, simple language
- Visual + text explanations
- Multiple learning pathways

## MODULE EVALUATION CRITERIA

### Good Module Characteristics
- Clear progression from simple to complex
- Concrete, student-relevant examples
- Interactive elements every few minutes
- Addresses common misconceptions explicitly
- Prepares directly for assessments

### Red Flags to Identify
- Abstract concepts without concrete examples
- Large conceptual jumps
- Overly complex language
- Instructor-focused rather than student-focused
- Assumes strong prior knowledge
- Lengthy calculations without concept teaching

## REVIEW PRIORITIES
1. Will struggling students understand this?
2. Is this as simple as possible?
3. Does this build appropriately from prior knowledge?
4. Are examples relevant to target students?
5. Is this aligned with learning outcomes?
6. Can this work on mobile devices?
7. Does this empower rather than discourage?

## REMEMBER
Every review should consider: "Does this serve the student studying alone at home, with low confidence and limited time?"

Content should feel supportive and achievable, not overwhelming or elitist.
