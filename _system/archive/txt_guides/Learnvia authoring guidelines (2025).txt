1. Intro
These guidelines focus on Learnvia authors, who are assumed to have already read Learnvia product vision doc. That doc describes content from a "What" perspective. This doc provides more of a "How" perspective. 


These guidelines are a "best effort" to create effective content that maximizes student learning. They are based in part on past experience and in part on belief. Understood is that some guidelines may be subjective. But importantly, the guidelines also aim for consistency. Content will come from different authors, and also content from different courses may be mix-and-matched by instructors. So the content benefits from having a consistent style. Authors who wish to depart from guidelines are asked to keep these overarching purposes in mind. 


Effective contributing authors have a strong ability to: 
* Break concepts into appropriately-sized pieces ("chunking")
* Teach incrementally without big jumps ("scaffolding")
* Stay focused on learning outcomes ("aligned")
* Motivate students via relevant connections to students' lives
* Create content that mathematicians will accept as correct/precise
* Follow authoring guidelines even when they disagree (suggestions welcome)
* Be a team player, accept and give constructive criticism (reviews will be extensive)
* Be responsible and responsive, with a strong time commitment


Effective content is:   
* Organized: Is well chunked, scaffolded, and aligned.  
* Concise: Uses the simplest words, figures, and animations to convey the concept.   
* Precise: Uses words accurately, avoiding synonyms/homonyms, vague references, etc. 
* Intuitive: Uses the simplest clearest illustrations and explanations 
* Concrete: Has student-relevant concrete examples throughout.   
* Interactive: Keeps students engaged with frequent short activities.   


Among the above, the most challenging for authors is Organization. Common issues: 
Chunks -- too large 
Scaffolding -- complex items added too early
Alignment -- tangents not relevant to learning outcomes 
 
Conciseness is a high priority. Authors should spend much time iteratively simplifying their animations, text, questions, and more. Remember: “It’s not done when nothing more can be added; it’s done when nothing more can be removed.”  “Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius – and a lot of courage – to move in the opposite direction.” -- Albert Einstein


In creating content, authors should consider a target learner who may be studying home alone, have low confidence, be scared of failing, and/or for whom time is not a luxury. That student differs greatly from a motivated well-supported student and even more from an instructor, who are often the targets of college-level content. 
2. A core module's lessons
Per the product vision doc, core modules teach the core concepts of a course, bookended by a motivation/intuition module and an exploration module. The centerpiece of a core module is a core lesson (maybe two), ideally bookended by an intro lesson and an expansion lesson, followed by homework and practice quiz activities. 


* Intro lesson: Provides students an initial "anchor" experience that benefits the subsequent learning of a new concept. For example, before a core lesson on Riemann sums for determining area under a curve, an intro lesson might ask the student to estimate the area via different sized rectangles and showing that more rectangles yield more accuracy.
* Core lesson: Teaches the main concept. For complex subjects, may be two core lessons. For Reimann sums, a first core lesson might show how a specific series of rectangles is  used to estimate area. A second lesson might show how the limit approaching infinite rectangles yields the exact area. 
* Expansion lesson: Provides further details such as complexities of a concept. For Reimann sums, might provide examples having a variety of more complex cases, like a curve extending above and below the x axis, or left and right of the y axis. Might walk through a detailed example that will eventually be a homework problem. 


All three kinds of lessons often have a similar pattern[a]: 
* Framing text: 100-150 words setting up the animated figure that follows and any key definitions, terminology, and mathematical concepts (theorems, formulas, etc.).
* Animated figure: A 2-3 min animated figure that does the main teaching, having about 3-5 scenes each with narrated caption text, and about 1-3 brief embedded questions. Note: In rare occasions, an animated figure may not be present, instead just brief text (e.g., definition), a table, or simple static figure. 
* Follow-up text: Sometimes, text appears here, especially with definitions that are now understandable after the animated figure. 
* Follow-up questions: Roughly 5-10 questions that continue to teach. May be 1 question set, or a few that group related Qs. 
* Brief summary: A few-sentence summary of key ideas and terms in the form of a bulleted list.
In the future, with the evolution of the Arc tool, we expect intro and expansion lessons to more heavily rely on interactive problems possible via Arc. But as of Spring 2025, the above pattern will be the focus. 


Questions in lessons (embedded, follow-up) are referred to as learning questions. 


As of Spring 2025, authors are given a lesson template in Google Slides including a real lesson's content. The author's task is to modify that template to the content they are authoring, staying within the template's constraints length and style. As such, we do not replicate that info here. 
3. Basic writing
Although our authors' main tasks emphasize animated figures and learning questions, writing is still present in those tasks and when creating other items. Clear writing remains essential. 


Clear writing is organized, concise, precise, and concrete. Key guidelines for authors: 
* No synonyms. Create one term for each concept and use that term exclusively, except where explicitly saying that multiple terms exist. Ex: Don't alternate between "average" and "mean". 
* No homonyms. Avoid the same word for two concepts. Ex: “The function's points are plotted. A key point is that the function's output is never negative.” Use: “The function's points are plotted. Notice that the function's output is never negative.”
* Simple sentences. Aim for subject-verb-object. Ex: Rather than "When planning a road trip, a first step is to check the tires," Use: "Planning a trip involves several steps. The first step is to check the tires." 
* Explicit structure. Use bulleted lists wherever appropriate. Use numbered lists if order matters.
* Active voice, but passive sometimes OK. Active voice can reduce ambiguity. Ex: "Plants were grown over the summer." By whom? Or just naturally? Better: "The homeowner grew plants over the summer." But passive is OK when authors do not want to specify the actor. Ex: Multiplication is applied first in an expression having both + and *".
* Singular. Writing in singular reduces ambiguity vs. plural. Ex: "Every human has a nose" rather than "All humans have noses," which could include a human having multiple noses. 
* Avoid vague references.  Avoid it, they, this, and other potentially vague references. 
   * Ex: In "The expression has one term. It uses two variables", the word "it" could refer to the expression or the term. Better: "The term uses two variables." 
   * Ex: "This is called a simple expression." Better: "An expression with one term is called a simple expression." 
   * Even when not vague, such words can increase cognitive load by requiring the reader to remember what the word/words is/are referencing.
   * In rare cases, the reflexive “itself” is acceptable.
* No lazy starts. Start with the real subject. Avoid starting with “There is/are” 
   * Ex: In "One can see that the expression cannot be simplified," the real subject doesn't appear until the sixth word. Better: "The expression cannot be simplified."
   * Ex: “There is a horizontal asymptote at y = 0." Better: "The graph of f has a horizontal asymptote at y = 0."
* Serial comma. Always use the serial (Oxford) comma. The serial comma improves clarity. Ex: In "Favorite breakfast options include cereal, pancakes and bread with cheese", the reader may have to read twice to realize the three options. Better: "...cereal, pancakes, and bread with cheese."
* Examples via Ex. Use examples frequently for concreteness (as above), and use Ex: for examples. The widespread e.g. comes across as formal and is less natural. Ex: "Some fractions yield a repeating decimal. Ex: 1/3 yields 1.333..."
   * Similarly, avoid i.e., instead using "specifically."
* Explaining vs. we.  Authors should strive to describe without unnecessary use of "we”. Ex: Rather than "We define slope as…", an author might write "Slope is defined as…". Otherwise, writing tends to inconsistently switch between descriptions and we statements.  Occasional use of we is OK, as in "We read f' aloud as f prime", because the sentence truly is referring to ourselves as people. 
* No pronouns other than we/us. Do not use he, she, it, they, or you. 




A few examples (from a real textbook): 
* It is essential that you understand how the average rate of change of f on an interval is connected to its graph.
   * Issues: Lazy start ("It is"), use of "you" (unnecessary), use of "its" (change, f, or interval?), sentence far from "subject-verb-object."
   * Alternative: The connection between f's average rate of change on an interval, and f's graph, is important to understand. 
* For a moving object with position function s, its average velocity...
   * Issues: "its" use is vague (object or s?)
   * Alternative: "...the object's average velocity..."
* If we want to consider the average rate of change of f on the interval, we compute...
   * Issues: Unnecessary/excessive "we" use
   * Alternative: The average rate of change of f on the interval is...


4. Animated figures in lessons
Overview
Video content has many benefits over static text and figures, providing better visualization, allowing for gradual unveiling, showing relationships, and being more natural for students. "Authoring" in our courseware consists largely of creating short videos teaching a concept, which is  very different from writing text. 


Our lessons typically center around an animated figure about 2-3 min long. 


Our main form of video is what we call an animated figure. Most static figures benefit from being animated. Whereas video can consist of a wide variety of things, an animated figure is more constrained. 
* Static figure: The most important part of an animated figure is the static version of that figure. Students will view content statically on the web and when printing, so authors should first develop a static figure that, along with all captions, teaches the animation's main concept, albeit not as ideally as the animation. The static figure appears on a page before the student plays it and appears afterward as well. 
* Unveiled: The primary animation that occurs is "unveiling". Unveiling means explaining a figure step-by-step, starting by showing a part of the figure, and then revealing (unveiling) more parts little-by-little, with explanations of each new part. Rarely should significant items disappear, unless they reappear in the static figure. 
* Scenes: Animated figures consist of about 3-5 scenes, each tens of seconds in length, with narration. Each scene continues the unveiling process. 
* Captions: Each scene has a caption, displayed as text and auto-played as audio. Captions should be concise. Animation should always be accompanied by narration, and vice-versa -- no long silent periods, nor lengthy narration with nothing happening visually. Captions primarily serve as narration, but all are also displayed to students below the animated figure and thus form some of the reading content of a lesson. 
* Embedded questions: 1-3 brief questions appear to keep the student engaged and ensure they are following along, usually reviewing or practicing a concept just taught, but sometimes setting up the next concept like "predict what's next".
* Motion: Motion is used to help students see connections, like a point flying from a table row to a plot. Motion is also used to show actual motion, like a car moving. 
* Color: Color is used to group related items, or to bring attention to key items. Color should not be the only means of differentiating between items. Color is not used for aesthetic purposes.


Creating animated figures 
A key authoring task is creating animated figures. This section describes the phases to create animated figures. 


Currently, authors specify the animated figures, and a specialist implements them. We use a tool called Arc to support animated figures. Arc generates animated figures from programs. An author's main task is to specify the animated figure's content such that our specialists can implement the spec. In the future, some authors may write Arc programs themselves. 
Phase 1: The static figure
The heart of an animated figure is a static figure that captures the essence of the concept being taught. An analogy might be the use of almost-entirely visual instructions rather than relying more on written instructions for assembling furniture, as depicted below.   
  
 
The above is just an analogy. Clearly learning math requires explanation too. But the idea is to flip things around from how a topic is commonly taught:  
* Usually, instructors/authors rely on explanations (verbal or textual), supplemented by figures along the way.  
* Instead, we teach as much as possible through a carefully thought-out static figure, plus minimal explanation, and animation.  


The static figure will be what a user sees prior to pressing “play”. The static figure is important so that the content is understandable when viewed statically, as it will be viewed that way often and also when printed on paper. The static figure above was not drawn in a mere 30 minutes; the designers creating such figures may have spent many hours aiming to find the best depiction, experimenting with many options. Notice, for example, how those authors teach how the boards should be oriented using the pointing finger and the X; those simple techniques convey a lot of information very intuitively and concisely.  


Suppose a lesson author is to teach this KSA: 
* Given a function described algebraically, the student is able to graph a function by plotting several points, then drawing a smooth curve through those points. 


And the author has seen the relevant homework questions, as described earlier.  


An author might first draw the following figure.  
  
 
 
But this does not teach how those points were plotted and the line drawn. As such, the author might extend the figure to show a table.  
  
 
The table helps, but the author wants to show that the table and plotted points come first, after which the curve is drawn.  
  
 
The author sees that the figure is rather complex. To simplify, the author decides to teach the negative values later (perhaps in a follow-up question). As a further simplification, the author decides to reduce the x axis values too. These changes also allow a left-to-right flow, which is preferred over the circular flow above.  
  
 
Giving yet another look at how the static figure can teach the concept, the author decides to add dotted lines to show the connection of a couple of the table values to the plotted points.  
  
 
 
Phase 2: The scenes 
Once the static figure is drawn, the author can focus on the animation scenes, typically 3-5. Some authors just describe each scene (caption, figure, action), and later draw the static figure for each scene. 


Scene 1: To represent a function like f(x) = x^2 graphically, we first calculate f(x) for several x values. When x = 0, x^2 = 0 * 0 = 0. When x = 1, x^2 = 1 * 1 = 1. Likewise for x = 2 and 3.  
* Show f(x) = x^2, then draw the table with labels and x values. Then show f(0) under f(x), 0^2 under x^2, add = 0, and copy and fly that 0 to the table. Below that equation for 0, repeat for 1. Below that, for 2 and for 3 at the same time. Once the table is filled in, grey those calculations’ text.  
* NOTE: The author now realizes that those calculations should probably be present in the static figure, but perhaps in a lighter font to not detract from the figure’s main concept.  


Scene 2: We can plot each x, f(x) pair as a point on the graph.  
* Create a red dot under 0, 0 in the table, and fly it to the plot, with a connecting arrow to show the correspondence. Repeat for 1,1, then for 2,4 and 3,9 simultaneously, but only draw a connecting arrow for 3,9.  


Scene 3: Finally, we can draw a smooth curve through those points. The curve is not drawn by straight lines between points; rather we try to draw a smooth curve through the points.  
* Draw line segments between each point. Put a big X over that figure, delete those lines, and then draw the smooth curve.  
* (The author might consider showing the straight line version in the static fig, perhaps small and to the upper right, but may decide that makes the figure too complex. Instead, the author decides to ask a follow-up question reminding students of the issue).  
 
Phase 3: Static fig per scene 
If the per-scene static figs weren’t created in Phase 2 above, then the author should create them now. (In simple cases where each fig is obvious from the description, this part may be skipped).  


Scene 1:  
  
 
Scene 2:  
  
 
Scene 3:  
  
 
The last fig should now be the static fig that the author first created. This final static fig is what the animator will draw first, and then will animate per each preceding scene.  


Note: The animation tool is being designed to provide first-class mobile support. As such, the courseware will allow students to view animated figures vertically, to avoid having to rotate their phone. The drawing canvas will thus be split into left and right halves, and the animator will position items so those halves can be viewed stacked, with left half on top and right half on bottom. Authors should think about this left/right to top/bottom situation when drawing their static figs.  


When a user requests to see a lesson in “expanded” view, or prints a lesson, the animated figure will be “unrolled” -- each scene will be shown with its accompanying static figure and caption text.  
Phase 4: The embedded questions 
Embedding a couple questions into animations/videos can help keep students engaged. On the other hand, questions may interrupt the flow of what is being taught, so a balance must be sought. Authors should think like a tutor explaining the animated figure to a student – where might a tutor pause and do a quick check that the student is following the main points.   Embedded questions should be quick and simple, not requiring written calculations. They should be multiple choice or short answer. Embedded questions are not "busy work"; they should really reinforce the main point(s). Soon to come: Arc will allow the student to enter text anywhere in the drawing, or click on a region of a drawing. Ex: A plotted point or a particular table cell.  


Above, a tutor might ask the student to plot one of the points. So the author might modify scene 2 to not plot the last point but instead ask the student to plot it, as follows:  
Scene 2: We can plot each x, f(x) pair as a point on the graph.  
* Create a red dot under 0, 0 in the table, and fly it to the plot, with a connecting arrow to show the correspondence. Repeat for 1,1, then for 2,4 (no connecting arrows).
After Scene 2:  
Q: Fill in f(3) in the table. (A box appears in the table for the student to type a value).  
Hint1: Substitute x = 3 into f(x) = x^2 
Hint2: f(3) = 3^2 = ?  
Ans: 9. Expl: f(3) = 3^2 = 9. We can then plot 3,9.  
* Upon the student entering the correct answer, proceed to animate, by showing a red dot under 3,9, and flying it over to the plot. End by drawing a connecting dotted arrow.  


The author also decides to ask a question to point out the straight-line issue:  


After Scene 4:  
Q: How do we connect the points?  
1. By drawing straight line segments between each pair of points. Expl: The graph of a single algebraic function doesn’t have straight line segments like that, but instead has a smooth curve.  
2. (correct) By drawing a smooth curve through all the points. Expl: A single algebraic function curves smoothly. If you are unclear how to draw a curve between points, you can plot more points in between until the curve’s shape becomes clearer.  


5. Follow-up learning questions in lessons
Overview
A lesson's questions (embedded and follow-up) are called learning questions. Learning questions are not homeworks or quizzes; they are a replacement for reading. A page of text is akin to a lecture, whereas learning questions are akin to a dialog. Authors spend much of their time teaching through learning questions and the associated hints and explanations. 


Learning questions should not involve lengthy calculations by students. A student should be able to answer a question directly, perhaps with very minimal calculation at times. 


General guidelines regarding learning questions: 


* Concise stem: A learning question's stem should be concise, usually one line of text or less. Authors should remember that many students do not have advanced English comprehension but can still excel at the topic being taught. 
   * Ex (bad): A common personal activity involves downloading a movie from a cloud service. We can estimate total download time from the time required to download part of the movie. Suppose downloading the first 1/4 of the movie took 30 sec. How long would downloading the rest of the movie require, given the initial time measured? 
      * Ex (better) If downloading 1/4 a movie takes 30 sec, downloading the rest will take ___ sec.
* Precise answer: Students complain when questions don't accept the "correct" answer. Authors should think about alternative ways students might interpret a question, and seek to reduce ambiguity. 
   * Ex:
      * Less good: Cars pollute ___ motorcycles.  Choices: more than, less than, about the same as. Issues: Gas or electric car? Does pollution include manufacturing or end-of-life disposal? How big are the engines of each? 
      * Better: The pollutants emitted by a 2000 cc gas car engine are likely ___ a 300 cc gas motorcycle engine. 
   * Ex:
      * Less good: The average lifetime of a car is ___. Issues: Single ownership duration, or lot-to-junkyard? Looking for an adjective like "long", or a number? If number, units? 
      * Better: The average car lifetime from being purchased new to being permanently taken off the road is ___ years. 


* Blanks: Many potential issues, such as creating non-parallel choices, are avoided by asking questions that use blanks. Such questions are usually a bit more concise too. Strive to form questions using blanks. 
   * Ex: 
      * Less good: What is the average life expectancy of a pet dog in the U.S.? Provide your answer in months. 
      * Better: The average life expectancy of a pet dog in the U.S. is ___ months. 
   * Ex: 
      * Less good: What substance in a popcorn kernel causes popping when heated?
      * Better: The ___ in a popcorn kernel causes popping when heated. 
   * Note that the ”‘question” may not actually be written as a statement for the student to complete. 
* Unique values: Use unique values to reduce potential confusion. 
   * Ex: 
      * Less good: The derivative of 2x^2 + 4x = ?  Ans: 4x + 4
         * Chance of confusing the two 2's or three 4's. Ex: Asks AI tutor: Where did the 4 come from? (Which 4?). Ex: AI tutor explains: The exponent 2 is reduced by 1 (Which 2?). 
      * Better: The derivative of 3x^2 + 5x = ? Ans: 6x + 5
Multiple choice
Multiple choice is desirable due to quick answering, plus directly addressing misconceptions and common errors.


Guidelines:  
* Short choices: Choices should be one word or at most a few words–a short expression. 
   * Factor out common text or expressions
      * Less good: "Most medical lawsuits ___." with choices: 
         * stem from improper expectations by the patient
         * result from the patient not trusting their doctor's abilities
         * are an outcome of a patient not liking their doctor's attitude
      * Better: "Most medical lawsuits arise from a patient’s ___." with choices: 
         * improper expectations
         * distrust of their doctor
         * dislike of their doctor's attitude
   * Choices should never be 3 independent sentences, each being a statement that is either true or false. 
   * Choices should be parallel, meaning of the same form and roughly the same length. 
* Always explain: Every choice should have an explanation. 
   * For each wrong choice, explain explicitly why the answer is wrong. Upon being told a choice is wrong, a "learning moment" occurs where the students wonders "Hey, why is that wrong?". Hence, creating good distractors, and explaining why wrong, is of great importance. 
   * For the right choice, assume the student guessed, so first explain why the choice is right or how we got to this answer (do the math). Then possibly expand. 
   * Keep explanations concise, one line, maybe two. (Note that stepped-out solutions to problems are acceptable.)
* Common misconceptions: Distractor choices should focus on common mistakes or misconceptions, and their explanations should start by directly saying why that choice is wrong. Distractors should not be nonsense choices. 
* Usually 3 choices: By default, aim for 3 choices, so 2 distractors. 
   * 4 choices OK if there are truly more common mistakes/misconceptions. 5 options is rare. 
   * 2 choices OK if more good distractors truly don't exist. Common when asking if something is valid/invalid like after teaching rules for a valid password, asking a series of questions each asking if a particular password like Cat123 is valid or invalid. Generally avoid questions asking if a statement is true or false (often devolving to an English test rather than a subject test).  


Example (* is correct): 
The ___ in a popcorn kernel causes popping when heated. 
(a) air  Expl: Although air is inside, the heated air seeps out and so does not cause the popping. 
(b)* water Expl: When heated, the liquid water inside a kernel turns to steam, which occupies more volume. The steam pushes against the kernel's walls, causing the popping. 
(c) starch Expl: Starch expands slightly when heated, but not enough to cause popping. 


Explanations should not say "Correct" or "Incorrect"; the platform will do that. 
Short answer
Short answer questions give students a chance to think a little more openly than multiple choice, and often are quite appropriate for math questions. Authors should aim for a mix of MC and SA questions. 


Guidelines: 


* Single precise answer: Students loathe being told their "correct" answer is wrong. Questions should be phrased to have a single clear answer. Authors should be hyper-vigilant in this regard. Where appropriate, authors should indicate how to type an answer, as in "Round to 2 decimal places" or "If not defined, type: undefined". 
* Hints: Authors must provide two general hints and may provide a series. Students can reveal one general hint at a time, in series order. After all hints are shown, the student sees a "Show answer" option instead. 
* Hints should (concretely) lead:  Each hint should explicitly lead students closer to the correct answer, usually concretely. Err on the side of helping -- follow-up questions are considered the "reading", not homework. General statements or questions can frustrate students. Be concrete. 
   * Ex: For question "Evaluate 3 + 4 * 7 - 2":
      * Hint 1: 
         * Good: * has highest precedence, so start with 4 * 7
         * Less good: * comes before + and -.
         * Frustrating: Remember the precedence rules. 
      * Hint 2: 3 + (4 * 7) - 2 = 3 + 28 - 2. With + and -,  evaluate left to right, so evaluate 3 + 28. 
   * Ex: For question "Find d/dx(x) * d/dx(x^2)"
      * Hint 1:
         * Good: d/dx(x) = 1. d/dx(x^2) = ?  Then multiply. 
         * Less good: Find each derivative separately, then multiply. 
   * General hints to avoid: 
      * Don't create hints that suggest the student made an error, like "Remember to multiply first" (who says they didn't?) or "Include one place after the decimal point". Students may assume the hint is based on their attempted answer that got marked wrong, and thus assume the system is incorrectly faulting their work. Instead, general hints should be obviously general, and simply lead students a step towards the answer. 
      * "Read XYZ and try again." Never ever do this. Such hints can be demoralizing. The hint series should be self-contained and not refer students elsewhere. Exception: A hint may refer to a figure in explaining how to obtain the answer, as in: In the figure above, count the items in the red box and multiply by 5. But not "The above figure has a clue. Can you find that clue?" 
      * Hints written in the form of a question. These types of hints could possibly lead to further confusion or be too broad. Aim for writing hints in the declarative form instead. 
* (Coming soon) Specific hints: If an author knows students are likely to enter a particular wrong answer, authors may provide a specific hint. If the system detects that wrong answer, it may make the specific hint available (perhaps immediately, or via a "Hint based on your answer" click). 
   * Ex: For question 3 + 5 * 7, the wrong answer 56 may yield this hint: 56 is obtained by evaluating left-to-right: (3 + 5) * 7 = 8 * 7 = 56, but * has precedence over +. Instead, evaluate the * first. 
   * Example: 
      * 5/2 * 3 seconds = ____ seconds.
      * Answer: 7.5
      * Hint1: One approach is to multiply 5 * 3, and then divide by 2.
      * Hint2: 5 * 3 = 15. Then 15 / 2 = ___. 
      * Hint3: (5 * 3) / 2 = 7.? 
      * Specific hint for 7.1: You may have obtained 7 by calculating (5 * 3) / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7 remainder 1. But the question asks for the answer as a decimal number, which is not obtained by putting the remainder after the decimal point. Instead, 15 / 2 = 7 1/2, so calculate 1/2 to determine the fractional part of the answer (the part after the decimal point).  
      * Specific hint for 0.8: You may have obtained 0.8 by calculating 5 / (2 * 3) = 5 / 6 = 0.8333, rounded to 0.8. 
      * Explanation: 5/2 * 3 is equivalent to (5 * 3) / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. 
      * Note that "Type answer as #.#" means that 7 1/2 need not be accepted as correct, and is less likely to be typed. 
* Multiple answers: Short-answer questions can accept multiple correct answers. Correctness is based on string matching or expression evaluation. Authors should aim to support reasonable variations, but need not support all possible variations. Note: Default is case insensitive, so cat, Cat, and CAT are the same. Future: Plural should be allowed, so cat and cats are the same. 
Long answer
Modern AI enables long-answer questions. Long answer questions involve a different and beneficial thinking process than short answer or multiple choice questions. But long answer questions take more time and mental energy. As such, authors should find a good balance between short- and long-answer questions. 


Common types of long answer questions: 
* Explain in English: The student describes a concept in their own words. Common setups include describing a concept, comparing two concepts, and pointing out what's wrong with a description. Ex: Explain how a limit enables the concept of instantaneous rate of change at a point. Ex: Describe the difference between average and instantaneous rate of change. Ex: What is wrong with the following argument? The faster you drive, the less time you spend on the road. The less time on the road, the less chance of an accident. Thus, driving faster leads to less accidents.
* Multi-line equations: The student enters a series of equations to solve a problem. 


Long answer questions have a number of associated points. AI grades and provides a score along with a description. 


Guidelines


* <1 per lesson. On average, we might expect a long answer question to appear every 2 or 3 lessons. Of course, a particular lesson might truly benefit from 2 long answer questions. If present, a long answer question would normally be the last question. The key is to attain the learning benefits of long answer question types without overworking the student. 
* Points: Whereas multiple choice and short answer questions are each worth 1 point, long answer questions are usually worth more points, typically around 4. 
* Rubric: Authors should ensure a question’s points are broken down into parts, perhaps 1 point each, that the AI can use for scoring and constructive feedback. The AI should be able to award fractional points, even if rounded up for reporting up the chain.  
Designing follow-up questions
A lesson typically starts with teaching a concept via an animated figure, tool, text, or some combo. After, the lesson asks more questions to continue teaching the concept, helping prepare students for subsequent homework questions. Key features of follow-up questions: 
1. About 5-10 questions
2. Start simple, build towards harder
3. Cover both concepts and calculations
4. Explicitly address common mistakes and misconceptions
5. Are quickly answerable. These are not homework problems. Rather, they replace reading. Think of a tutor still teaching but having the student predict next steps or perform partial calculations, before having students do homework on their own. 


Authors should look carefully at the module’s relevant homework and quiz questions, and aim to prepare students to answer those questions, taking small steps towards answering those latter questions. 


Authors should first plan which questions they will ask. For the KSA: 
* Given a function described algebraically, the student is able to graph a function by plotting several points, then drawing a smooth curve through those points.
the author decides to start with filling a table, then converting a table to plotted points, and finally drawing a curve through points. 


The author also thinks of common mistakes from their teaching experience, including getting y’s sign wrong for x^2 or x^3, and plotting too few points or poorly-chosen points to properly draw the curve. The author sketches these questions: 
1. Given a function (something with x^2), complete a table from –5 to 5 by filling in the two missing points. This is the first example in which students are seeing negatives, so one might remind students that the y values are all non-negative. 
2. For a given function, choose which set of points is best for drawing a curve. Distractors should include too few points, and omitting x = 0. 
3. Given a table from –5 to 5 (again something with x^2), choose which plotted points match that table. A distractor to include is the common mistake of plotting –x values as –y values. 
4. Repeat but for x^3. A distractor to include is having –x values plotted as +y values.
5. Given plotted points from –5 to 5, choose the best curve. Something with x^2 again.
6. Now do –3 to 3 using something with x^3. That curve bends at 0. 


The above follow-up questions should prepare students for the homework questions, and satisfies most of the A-E requirements. But, missing are conceptual questions. So the author adds: 
7. If plotting a function for both negative and positive x values, why should you usually plot the function for x = 0?  
8. For the function 3x^2, what is the minimum number of points needed to graph the function from 0 to 5?  Ans: at least 3, because 2 doesn’t give sense of the curve. But, more than 3 is better. 


Feeling comfortable that those questions cover A-E, the author can proceed to create multiple choice and short answer questions. If the author went a bit over the 5-10 question suggestion, but the questions are relatively easy, it’s OK. 


Common authoring mistakes, usually caused by lack of planning: 
1. Too many questions
2. Taking big jumps between questions rather than building from simple to harder
3. Forgetting to ask conceptual questions 
4. Forgetting to address common mistakes or misconceptions
5. Too much calculation (follow-up questions aren’t homework problems)
6. Combining too many things at once
7. Unnecessary complexity detracting from a question's main point


6. Authoring lessons
Lesson design
Because we currently ask authors to follow a particular lesson template, we do not address lesson design here in great detail at this time as of spring 2025 (perhaps in the future). Here, we simply state that the author should focus on ensuring the targeted learner is well supported, via the simplest, most-intuitive, carefully-scaffolded lesson the author can possibly create. As long as a student has the basic prerequisite knowledge, that student should ideally be able to understand and practice everything being taught. That challenge is a tall one for authors, and hard to achieve, but it is achievable. 
Lessons work toward homework
“Alignment” in educational content is “the process of ensuring that all the components work together to help students achieve the intended learning outcomes.” To achieve alignment, this content uses “backwards design” wherein:
* First, starting with learning outcomes, we create exam-worthy questions to cover those learning outcomes. 
   * Each learning outcome relies on a few KSA (knowledge/skills/abilities), and each module teaches a few KSAs. 
* Second, we create per-module quiz questions to prepare students for exam questions.
* Third, we create homework questions to prepare students for quiz questions. 


Thus, lesson authors know what KSAs the lesson should cover, plus can see the relevant homework and quiz questions that their lesson is working towards helping students answer. Lesson authors should stay focused on those KSAs and the homework questions, to avoid teaching unnecessary topics and to keep the content aligned. 


For example, a lesson may be focused on the following KSA: 
* Given a function described algebraically, the student is able to graph a function by plotting several points, then drawing a smooth curve through those points.


The lesson author can see homework questions on:  
1. Filling in a table for a function described algebraically and plotting those points
2. Drawing a smooth curve through given points, and 
3. Doing both of those things given just a function’s algebraic description. 
The homework’s most complete question is on (c) and in this form: 
* Q: Given f(x) = 3x^2 + 1, graph the function from x = -3 to x = 3 . First create a table with at least 6 well-chosen points , then draw the function’s graph. 
As such, the lesson author decides to:
* Create an animated figure that teaches (a), (b) and (c).
* Create follow-up questions that walk students through (a), (b), and (c) as well. 
Analysis of a "good" lesson
Authors can benefit from an analysis of a generally-considered "good" lesson. We put good in quotes because lessons can always be made better. 


The lesson being analyzed currently exists as Lesson 2.3.2, "Modeling an object's position", at https://intuition-nightly.vercel.app/Calculus1Dev -- all subject to change so care should be taken to ensure one is looking at the intended lesson. 
Overall
Lesson 2.3.2. The lesson is a good size "chunk". The student already knows about functions being representable as a table, as a graph, or algebraically. The student has seen simpler functions like x^2, so the slightly more complex function, s(t), is OK here, and is used to provide a real example. The lesson stays focused on using a function to represent a real moving object vs time and doesn't go on tangents. 


Because time is a challenging feature, the lesson has the object move only up and down, without horizontal motion. That up/down matches nicely with the y axis' vertical orientation. 


The lesson directly aims to dispel the very common misconception among students that the horizontal axis represents horizontal motion, such as the ball being thrown forward. 
Framing text  
* Text is concise, takes just a few seconds to read. However, some suggest this text is a bit too long and detailed. 
* Note use of "This situation is modeled" instead of the common "This is modeled" (what is "This"?)
* All symbols are defined s, t, v0, h0. 
* Use of "Ex" to keep text simple. 
Animated figure
  

Static view: 
* Concise: Almost nothing could be removed from the static figure. 
   * In fact, note the Upward and Downward depictions do NOT have the associated times labeled (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8); even though helpful, the author felt they might be overwhelming and not strictly essential. Could go either way on that. 
* Organized: Good left-to-right top-to-bottom org, good labels and separation. Also supports mobile vertical view as the right half can go under the left half. 
* Color: Used superbly to group items: height items are purple, the ball and its points are green, time is orange. Color also used for four box labels. No extraneous use of color. 
* Static view teaches all concepts
   * Especially note: Motion of ball uses the Upward and Downward depictions to statically indicate the ball's motion and sampled points. Ensuring the figure teaches its concepts statically is important. Author did NOT try to put the static balls on the left axis, since up and down would not be easily distinguished (and if up were on the left of axis and down on right, would look like horizontal motion). 


Animation: 
* Concise: Only about 2 min
* Shows ball's motion uninterrupted, then breaks it down. 
* Motion: Flies values from Motion box to Tabular box to show how the table is populated.
   * Unveils static Upward/Downward fig over time to help teach what it represents
* Unveils: Exposes Graphical box later, to let student initially focus just on the ball and then table. 
   * Motion again used to fly values from table to graph so the student knows where those graphed points come from.
   * Note that the lines from (1,112) to axes are re-veiled (hidden) at the end, since a later point has such lines. Author sought to keep the static image simple and didn't want two sets of such lines. 
Questions
Embedded questions:
* The questions are very short, just quickly checking whether the student is following the key concepts. 
   * Students can answer in just a couple seconds. No harder calculations. Just a quick check that the student is following. 
* The questions don't interrupt the main flow of the video with lengthy diversions. 


Follow-up questions: 
* The follow-up questions start by reviewing key concepts from the animation, then expand a bit further to teach about how the function models the ball over time. 
* The long-answer question requires the student to justify a key concept themselves.


Multiple-choice questions: 
* Question stems are concise, just one line. 
* Choices are concise, just a few words or less. 
* Explanations are concise, typically one short sentence.
   * Wrong choice has explicit indication of why wrong, vs just stating a fact
   * Right choice shows exactly how to obtain the answer; assumes student guessed


Short-answer questions: 
* Questions stems are concise, just one line. 
* Uses "blank" approach for conciseness and unambiguity and to reduce likelihood of student typing something unexpected, like student including the units, or typing a sentence where just a number (or word) was expected.  
Addressing misconception
Author has directly addressed the common misconception that the horizontal axis represents horizontal motion, starting simply with embedded question Q2, then a multiple choice question whose explanation explicitly mentions the common misconception, and finally a long-answer question that requires the student to explain why that misconception is wrong. Not every lesson topic will involve misconceptions, but addressing common ones directly is important. 


Analysis of a "less good" lesson
Coming soon (Spring 2025)
7. Motivation/intuition module
Every chapter should start with a motivation/intuition module, and end with an exploration module. 
* Motivation / intuition module
   * First module of every chapter consists of 1-2 lessons on motivation and 1-2 on intuition
      * Should use examples that span wide variety of student experiences, while avoiding controversial topics
      * For Calculus, examples should spread across biological science, engineering, computer science, and business/economics. 
      * Example at a chapter level: 
         * First lesson describes a key problem like "Modeling is useful. By modeling human respiration, we can simulate medical treatments and determine their effects. And modeling fire allows for realistic graphics in movies".  Shows examples visually. 
         * Second lesson lets a student tweak parameters of a medical treatment and see effect on respiration. 
         * Third lesson tweaks a fire model and for students to visually see impact on realism. 
         * Fourth lesson points to what will be learned in the rest of the chapter that enables such models. 
   * Note: Motivation and intuition lessons also appear in about every 3-5 subsequent modules.
      * Example at the module level: Teaching that a circle's circumference is 2𝜋r
         * First lesson motivates: Examples, like determining how much edging to buy for a round garden
         * Second lesson provides Intuition: Try drawing different-sized circles, measure the diameter and circumference, and compute the ratio. Notice the ratio is always about 3. 
         * Subsequent 2-3 lessons teach specifics: Introduce the formula 2𝜋r, noting that pi is the ~3 value from the intuition. Apply to calculating the garden edging. 
         * Only applies to certain modules; maybe 15-25% of them.


* Exploration module
   * Preceding each chapter summary module is an "Exploration" module that applies the chapter's content, even if indirectly, in an interesting/exciting way for students. Often involves simulations (e.g., pre-written plotting python code, modifiable) using real/realistic data (e.g., lake temperatures). 


8. Miscellaneous
These guidelines are a work in progress. Extensive additions are expected as we develop more kinds of content, and aim for authors to further perfect their art. 
Interesting reference 
In the book Multimedia Learning (Cambridge Press, 2001), Richard E. Mayer discusses twelve principles that shape the design and organization of multimedia presentations: 
1. Coherence Principle – People learn better when extraneous words, pictures and sounds are excluded rather than included. 
2. Signaling Principle – People learn better when cues that highlight the organization of the essential material are added. 
3. Redundancy Principle – People learn better from graphics and narration than from graphics, narration and on-screen text. 
Spatial Contiguity Principle – People learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented near rather than far from each other on the page or screen. 
4. Temporal Contiguity Principle – People learn better when corresponding words and pictures are presented simultaneously rather than successively.
5. Segmenting Principle – People learn better from a multimedia lesson that is presented in user-paced segments rather than as a continuous unit. 
6. Pre-training Principle – People learn better from a multimedia lesson when they know the names and characteristics of the main concepts.
7. Modality Principle – People learn better from graphics and narrations than from animation and on-screen text. 
8. Multimedia Principle – People learn better from words and pictures than from words alone. 
9. Personalization Principle – People learn better from multimedia lessons when words are in conversational style rather than formal style. 
10. Voice Principle – People learn better when the narration in multimedia lessons is spoken in a friendly human voice rather than a machine voice. 
11. Image Principle – People do not necessarily learn better from a multimedia lesson when the speaker’s image is added to the screen
