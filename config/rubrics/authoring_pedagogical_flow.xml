  <purpose>
    Evaluates how well content guides students through the learning process, including
    motivation, scaffolding, practice opportunities, and reinforcement strategies.
  </purpose>

  <evaluation_criteria>
    <severity level="5" label="Critical">
      <criteria>
        <criterion>No scaffolding for complex concepts</criterion>
        <criterion>Missing essential practice opportunities</criterion>
        <criterion>Completely absent learning objectives</criterion>
        <criterion>No connection to student prior knowledge</criterion>
      </criteria>
      <examples>
        <example type="violation">Presenting advanced formulas without building intuition</example>
        <example type="violation">Theory-only content with no application or practice</example>
        <example type="violation">Learning objectives present but no motivational connection explaining why this matters to students</example>
      </examples>
    </severity>

    <severity level="4" label="Major">
      <criteria>
        <criterion>Insufficient scaffolding for difficult topics</criterion>
        <criterion>Poor balance between instruction and practice</criterion>
        <criterion>Weak or missing motivational elements</criterion>
        <criterion>Inadequate feedback mechanisms</criterion>
        <criterion>BACKWARD DESIGN VIOLATIONS: Lesson teaches concepts not in homework/quiz (tangent)</criterion>
        <criterion>BACKWARD DESIGN VIOLATIONS: Homework requires skills not taught in lessons (gap)</criterion>
      </criteria>
      <examples>
        <example type="violation">One example for a complex multi-step process</example>
        <example type="violation">No worked examples before practice problems</example>
        <example type="violation">Missing explanations of real-world relevance</example>
        <example type="violation">Lesson content tangential to homework - teaches material not assessed</example>
        <example type="violation">Follow-up questions don't prepare for homework complexity</example>
        <example type="real" source="5.6_CE_line_11">
          Issue: Question hint and explanation both refer to the "Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1," which students do not learn until the next lesson
          Impact: References concept students haven't learned yet; breaks scaffolding
          Fix: Rewrite Hint 1 and Explanation if appropriate
        </example>
      </examples>
      <backward_design_note>
        Content uses backward design: Exam → Quiz → Homework → Lessons.
        Lessons must directly prepare students for homework. Tangential content
        or insufficient preparation for homework are MAJOR violations.
