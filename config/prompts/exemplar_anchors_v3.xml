      <issue>
        Q1 asks to verify a function is even. Q2 should probably use this fact.
        It only asks for a definite integral on [0,a] which does not rely on even/odd.
      </issue>

      <student_impact>
        Missed scaffolding opportunity—students cannot apply the even/odd insight
        they just developed in Q1 to Q2. This reduces learning reinforcement and makes
        Q1 seem disconnected from Q2, when they should build on each other.
      </student_impact>

      <recommended_fix>
        Rewrite Q2 to evaluate the integral on the symmetric interval [-a,a] so
        students can leverage the evenness property from Q1.

      <quoted_text>Uses the word "property" in explanation</quoted_text>

      <issue>
        To what does "property" refer? The word "property" hasn't been used in this
        lesson so far. Will students understand what property means in this context?
      </issue>

      <student_impact>
        Students studying alone have no reference for what "property" means in this
        mathematical context (is it the sum property? power property? general theorem?).
        Without definition, they cannot understand the explanation and may give up or
        develop misconceptions.
      </student_impact>

      <recommended_fix>
        Replace "property" with explicit language (e.g., "sum rule for integrals",
        "linearity property of integration") or define "property" earlier in the lesson.
        Term appears in multiple questions—search and adjust throughout module.
      </recommended_fix>

      <question>Q1:RSA</question>
      <location>Answer explanation</location>

      <quoted_text>"the sum property of integrals"</quoted_text>

      <issue>
        Will students know "the sum property of integrals"? A google search doesn't
        net any results. Does this go by another name, like "sum rule"?
      </issue>

      <student_impact>
        This terminology may not match what students learned in previous courses.
        Students will be confused trying to recall "sum property" when they learned
        it as "sum rule" or "linearity", disrupting their problem-solving flow.
      </student_impact>

      <recommended_fix>
        Replace "the sum property of integrals" with more standard terminology like
        "sum rule for integrals" or define the term first. Note: referenced multiple
        times in explanation—requires multiple edits.

      <section>Follow-Up Question</section>
      <question>Q1:MC</question>
      <location>Option 3 Explanation, second sentence</location>

      <quoted_text>
        The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 connects the definite integral
        of f(x) with the values of its antiderivative at the endpoints.
      </quoted_text>

      <issue>
        Can "its" be replaced with f(x)'s in the following sentence?
      </issue>

      <student_impact>
        Pronoun "its" creates ambiguity—students may wonder if "its" refers to f(x),
        the definite integral, or the FTC itself. This ambiguity forces rereading and
        disrupts comprehension flow for students with lower reading skills.
      </student_impact>

      <recommended_fix>
        Replace "its" with "f(x)'s" for clarity: "...with the values of f(x)'s
        antiderivative at the endpoints."
      </recommended_fix>
    </example>

    <example id="vague_pronoun_2" severity="2" confidence="0.8">

      <quoted_text>We need to double it because f is even.</quoted_text>

      <issue>
        To what is "it" referring in the following sentence?
      </issue>

      <student_impact>
        The pronoun "it" could refer to the function, the integral, or the interval.
        Students must pause to decode the reference instead of focusing on the
        mathematical concept of even functions and integration.
      </student_impact>

      <recommended_fix>
        Replace "it" with explicit noun: "We need to double the integral from 0 to a
        because f is even" or "We need to double this value because f is even."
      </recommended_fix>
    </example>

      <quoted_text>
        In this lesson, we will explore how to use the FTC together with the chain rule
        to find derivatives of integrals with upper a function as an upper limit.
      </quoted_text>

      <issue>
        The end of the sentence is unclear: "...with upper a function as an upper limit."
      </issue>

      <student_impact>
        Grammatically awkward phrasing ("upper a function as an upper limit") confuses
        students. They must spend cognitive energy parsing the sentence structure instead
        of understanding the mathematical concept being introduced.
      </student_impact>

      <recommended_fix>
        Revise for clarity: "...to find derivatives of integrals that have a function
        as their upper limit" or "...with a function serving as the upper limit of
        integration."
      </recommended_fix>

      <question>QS3, Q2:SA</question>
      <location>Prompt, first sentence</location>

      <quoted_text>
        In the previous part, we considered the integral of the odd function f(x) = 2x
        over the interval [-5, 5].
      </quoted_text>

      <issue>
        The use of "part" is confusing here, since it makes me think of the FTC Part 1
        or Part 2. Can "part" be replaced with "problem" or "question"?
      </issue>

      <student_impact>
        The word "part" triggers students to think about "FTC Part 1" and "FTC Part 2"
        (key concepts in this module), causing momentary confusion about whether this
        references a theorem part or just the previous question.
      </student_impact>

      <recommended_fix>
        Replace "part" with "question" or "problem": "In the previous question, we
        considered..." This eliminates the terminology collision.
      </recommended_fix>

      <quoted_text>
        The displacement includes direction to the displacement will be less than the
        total distance traveled.
      </quoted_text>

      <issue>
        Explanation is unclear. See second sentence.
      </issue>

      <student_impact>
        Ungrammatical sentence ("direction to the displacement") obscures the relationship
        between displacement and distance. Students with lower reading skills may
        misunderstand this key concept for net change problems.
      </student_impact>

      <recommended_fix>
        Displacement includes direction, so the displacement will be less than the total
        distance traveled.

      <location>Question Hint 1 and Explanation</location>

      <issue>
        Question hint and explanation both refer to the "Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
        Part 1," which students do not learn until the next lesson.
      </issue>

      <student_impact>
        Students cannot use a hint that references a theorem they haven't learned yet.
        This creates frustration and undermines the scaffolding purpose of hints.
        Students may incorrectly assume they should already know FTC Part 1.
      </student_impact>

      <recommended_fix>
        Rewrite Hint 1 and Explanation to use concepts already covered in this lesson,
        or add a brief preview statement: "The next lesson will formalize this
        relationship as FTC Part 1."

      <issue>
        Prompt is in the form of a question instead of a statement.
      </issue>

      <student_impact>
        Minor style inconsistency. Statement format is preferred for embedded questions
        as it better integrates with the fill-in-the-blank answer structure.
      </student_impact>

      <recommended_fix>

      <student_impact>
        Students cannot correctly answer the question because the visual contradicts
        the problem statement. This creates confusion about which function to analyze
        and undermines trust in the materials.
