  <target_learner>
    <profile>
      Content is designed for students who may be studying alone at home, have low
      confidence, are scared of failing, and for whom time is not a luxury. Target
      students often have test anxiety and fear making mistakes. Feedback must be
      encouraging, not intimidating.
    </profile>
    <key_difference>
      This differs greatly from well-supported motivated students or instructors.
      Always evaluate with the struggling, anxious, time-limited student in mind.

        <description>
          Authors MUST provide at least two general hints and may provide a series.
          Students reveal hints one at a time in series order.
        </description>
      </requirement>

      <requirement id="hints_must_lead" severity="high">
        <title>Hints Must Concretely Lead (CRITICAL)</title>
        <description>
          Each hint must explicitly lead students closer to the correct answer, usually concretely.
          Follow-up questions are considered "reading", not homework. Think of a tutor teaching
          while having the student predict next steps. Err on the side of helping.

          <principle>Be concrete, not general</principle>

        </detailed_example>

        <rationale>
          General statements or questions frustrate students studying alone.
          Without concrete guidance, struggling students give up rather than persist.

      <requirement id="no_error_hints" severity="high">
        <title>Never Suggest Student Made Error</title>
        <description>
          Don't create hints that suggest the student made an error, like "Remember to multiply first"
          or "Include one place after the decimal point". Students may assume the hint is based on
          their attempted answer and think the system is incorrectly faulting their work.
        </description>
        <guideline>
          General hints should be obviously general and simply lead students a step toward the answer.
        </guideline>
      </requirement>

      <requirement id="no_redirect_hints" severity="high">
        <title>Never Redirect to Other Content</title>
        <description>
          NEVER say "Read XYZ and try again." Such hints are demoralizing.
          The hint series should be self-contained and not refer students elsewhere.
        </description>
        <exception>
          A hint may refer to a figure in explaining how to obtain the answer:
          "In the figure above, count the items in the red box and multiply by 5."
          But NOT: "The above figure has a clue. Can you find that clue?"

      <requirement id="declarative_hints" severity="medium">
        <title>Declarative Form, Not Questions</title>
        <description>
          Hints written as questions could lead to further confusion or be too broad.
          Aim for writing hints in declarative form instead.

          <critical_instruction>
            If you are unsure whether a term is Calc 1 vs. Calc 2, DO NOT FLAG IT.
            False positives waste author time. Only flag when confident the term is
            NEW to this specific module.

      <when_uncertain>
        If uncertain whether a term is new or prerequisite, DO NOT FLAG IT.
        False positives waste author time. Only flag when confident the term is NEW to this module.

          If a term would naturally appear BEFORE the current module in a typical Calc 2 textbook,
