# Exemplar Anchors and Few-shot Guidance

Use these curated excerpts from two fully reviewed modules as gold-standard references. Do not flag patterns that match these exemplars. Prefer fixes and wording that align with their style and structure.

## Exemplar A: 5.6 — The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Framing text excerpt)

"Derivatives measure how fast a function changes. Integrals measure how much a quantity accumulates. At first, the concepts may appear unrelated. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) reveals the connection by showing that the derivative of an integral function equals the original integrand and that definite integrals can be computed through antiderivatives.

Imagine water flowing into a tank at a steady rate. An integral measures the accumulation of flow rate over time and gives the total amount of water in the tank. If the derivative of that accumulation function is taken, the result is the flow rate again. In other words, the derivative shows how fast the total is growing at each moment, matching the original inflow rate."

Characteristics to mirror (do-not-flag if present):
- Simple, concrete analogy that motivates the concept (tank and water flow)
- Clear link between intuition and formal statement
- Concise sentences at ~8th grade reading level
- Key math in LaTeX within <m>…</m> when embedded in prose

## Exemplar B: 5.7 — Net Change Theorem (Framing text excerpt)

"Checking a stock market investment every day can be stressful. The value might go up on Monday, drop on Tuesday, rise again on Wednesday, and fall on Thursday. The daily ups and downs can be overwhelming. But what really matters to an investor is simple. When it is time to sell, the investor wants to know if the investment gained or lost value relative to the purchase price. The investor is only interested in the net change, or overall change, in the value of the investment.

The net change in a function F(x) over an interval [a, b] is F(b) − F(a). Net change measures the overall gain or loss between the starting value x = a and the ending value x = b. This lesson will demonstrate how to find the net change of a function."

Characteristics to mirror (do-not-flag if present):
- Everyday-context analogy leading to formal definition
- Short, sequential sentences without introductory clauses
- Explicit definition using singular form and precise terms

## Positive patterns (treat as correct if you see them)
- Definitions written as: <definition><b>Term</b> is …</definition>
- Explanations that first motivate with a concrete example, then generalize
- Follow-up question explanations that directly tie back to definitions or prior steps
- MC and SA explanations that state why distractors are wrong and how to get the right answer

## Few-shot: compliant issue examples (structure and tone)

1) Category: Structural Integrity (high impact)
- Line 0003: "<Title>Todo</Title>"
- Student impact: Students cannot identify module topic from title, preventing effective navigation
- Suggested fix: Change to a precise, content-bearing title, e.g., "<Title>Power Series: Radius and Interval of Convergence</Title>"
- Severity: 5; Confidence: 1.0

2) Category: Conceptual Clarity (content accuracy)
- Lines 0042–0043: "At x = −1: ∑ (−1/n) diverges (harmonic series with alternating signs becomes the negative harmonic series)."
- Student impact: Confuses alternating series with sign-flipped harmonic series at x = −1
- Suggested fix: "At x = −1: ∑ (1/n) diverges as the harmonic series (the (−1)^n and −1 terms cancel)."
- Severity: 4; Confidence: 0.85

3) Category: Assessment Quality (question design)
- Location: Homework set — Q2 depends on parity from Q1 but stem does not leverage it
- Student impact: Missed scaffolding opportunity; students cannot apply even/odd insight
- Suggested fix: Rewrite Q2 to evaluate the integral on the symmetric interval [−a, a] so evenness can be used
- Severity: 3; Confidence: 0.75

4) Category: Punctuation & Grammar (clarity, copyedit)
- Line 00NN: "The displacement includes direction to the displacement will be less than the total distance traveled."
- Student impact: Ungrammatical sentence obscures meaning for struggling readers
- Suggested fix: "Displacement includes direction, so the displacement will be less than the total distance traveled."
- Severity: 2; Confidence: 0.8

Reminder:
- Always include line numbers and exact quoted text.
- If confidence < 0.6, do not flag.
- Visual/animation elements remain out of scope for text reviewers.
