## Good Catches (Keep These Patterns)

These TEXT issues were correctly identified and accepted/addressed by reviewers:


### Good Catch 1

**Section:** Homework Problem
**Issue:** Q1 asks to verify a function is even. Q2 should probably use this fact.  It only asks for a definite integral on [0,a] which does not rely on even/odd.
**Recommended Edit:** Rewrite Q2 to evaluate the integral on the symmetric interval [-a,a].
**Notes:** Added a question.

### Good Catch 2

**Section:** Follow-Up Question
**Issue:** The answers do not include explanations.
**Recommended Edit:** Add explanations.
**Notes:** Explanations added

---

### Good Catch 3

**Section:** Follow-Up Question
**Issue:** No explanation given in answer.
**Recommended Edit:** 
**Notes:** Explanation added

---

### Good Catch 4

**Section:** Follow-Up Question
**Issue:** I looks like most of these were copied and pasted from 5.7.3 as displacement questions, but this is the total distance section.
**Recommended Edit:** 
**Notes:** Questions rewritten using distance traveled
