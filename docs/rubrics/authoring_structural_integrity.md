# Structural Integrity Rubric

## Overview
This rubric evaluates the logical organization and coherence of educational content, ensuring materials follow sound instructional design principles and maintain clear progression of concepts.

## Scoring Scale
- **4 - Exemplary**: Exceptional structural organization that enhances learning
- **3 - Proficient**: Well-organized content with clear logical flow
- **2 - Developing**: Basic organization present but with some gaps
- **1 - Inadequate**: Poor organization that impedes learning

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Logical Sequencing (25%)

#### Exemplary (4)
- Concepts build systematically from foundational to advanced
- Prerequisites clearly established before introducing dependent topics
- Smooth transitions between related concepts
- Learning objectives align perfectly with content progression

#### Proficient (3)
- Generally logical progression of concepts
- Most prerequisites covered before dependent material
- Clear transitions in most sections
- Learning objectives mostly align with content

#### Developing (2)
- Some logical sequencing evident
- Occasional gaps in prerequisite coverage
- Transitions sometimes unclear or missing
- Partial alignment between objectives and content

#### Inadequate (1)
- Random or illogical concept ordering
- Prerequisites frequently missing or introduced after dependent content
- No clear transitions between topics
- Misalignment between objectives and content

### 2. Content Chunking (25%)

#### Exemplary (4)
- Content divided into optimal cognitive load units
- Each chunk focuses on single, clear learning objective
- Consistent chunk sizing appropriate to complexity
- Perfect balance between detail and digestibility

#### Proficient (3)
- Content generally well-divided
- Most chunks have clear focus
- Chunk sizes mostly appropriate
- Good balance overall with minor issues

#### Developing (2)
- Inconsistent content division
- Some chunks too large or unfocused
- Variable chunk sizes without clear rationale
- Occasional cognitive overload issues

#### Inadequate (1)
- Poor or no content chunking
- Chunks lack clear focus or purpose
- Extreme variation in chunk sizes
- Frequent cognitive overload or insufficient detail

### 3. Scaffolding Architecture (25%)

#### Exemplary (4)
- Sophisticated scaffolding with gradual complexity increase
- Support structures perfectly matched to learning needs
- Clear progression from guided to independent practice
- Seamless integration of review and reinforcement

#### Proficient (3)
- Good scaffolding present throughout
- Support structures generally appropriate
- Clear progression in most areas
- Regular review and reinforcement

#### Developing (2)
- Basic scaffolding attempted
- Some support structures present but inconsistent
- Unclear progression in places
- Sporadic review and reinforcement

#### Inadequate (1)
- Little to no scaffolding evident
- Insufficient support for complex concepts
- No clear progression path
- Absent or ineffective review mechanisms

### 4. Cross-Reference Integrity (25%)

#### Exemplary (4)
- All cross-references accurate and functional
- Bidirectional linking where appropriate
- Clear indication of reference purpose
- Comprehensive index and navigation aids

#### Proficient (3)
- Most cross-references accurate
- Good use of internal linking
- Reference purposes generally clear
- Adequate navigation aids

#### Developing (2)
- Some cross-reference errors
- Inconsistent internal linking
- Reference purposes sometimes unclear
- Basic navigation aids only

#### Inadequate (1)
- Frequent cross-reference errors or broken links
- Minimal or no internal linking
- Reference purposes unclear or missing
- Poor or absent navigation aids

## Implementation Guidelines

### Assessment Process
1. Review entire content structure before detailed evaluation
2. Map concept dependencies and prerequisites
3. Evaluate each section against criteria
4. Check all cross-references and navigation elements
5. Calculate weighted score

### Common Issues to Address
- **Concept jumping**: Introducing advanced topics before foundations
- **Orphaned content**: Sections disconnected from main flow
- **Circular dependencies**: Topics that reference each other without clear entry point
- **Cognitive overload**: Sections attempting to cover too much at once

### Improvement Recommendations
- Create concept dependency maps
- Implement consistent chunking guidelines (e.g., 5-7 main points per section)
- Develop clear transition templates
- Establish cross-reference verification process

## Scoring Matrix

| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-4) | Weighted Score |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Logical Sequencing | 25% | | |
| Content Chunking | 25% | | |
| Scaffolding Architecture | 25% | | |
| Cross-Reference Integrity | 25% | | |
| **Total** | **100%** | | |
