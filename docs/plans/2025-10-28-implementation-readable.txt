LEARNVIA AI REVISION SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Plain English Version for Stakeholders
Date: October 28, 2025

================================================================================
WHAT WE'RE BUILDING
================================================================================

We're creating a computer program that automatically reviews educational content
using 60 AI reviewers working together. Think of it like having 60 teaching
experts instantly read every module and provide organized feedback.

The goal: Reduce human reviewer workload by 70-80% while maintaining our high
quality standards for educational content.


================================================================================
THE PROBLEM WE'RE SOLVING
================================================================================

Current Situation:
- Human reviewers spend 3-4 hours reviewing each module
- Authors wait 2-3 days for feedback
- Different reviewers give inconsistent feedback
- Expensive process that creates bottlenecks
- Authors often feel discouraged by harsh correction-focused feedback

What This Causes:
- Slow module production
- Frustrated authors
- Burned out reviewers
- High costs
- Inconsistent quality


================================================================================
HOW OUR SOLUTION WORKS (IN SIMPLE TERMS)
================================================================================

Think of it like a medical diagnosis with multiple specialists:

1. MODULE GOES IN
   Your author submits their educational module (just a text document).

2. 60 AI SPECIALISTS EXAMINE IT
   - 30 specialists check teaching quality
     "Are the examples clear?"
     "Do concepts build properly?"
     "Will students understand this?"

   - 30 specialists check writing mechanics
     "Is the grammar correct?"
     "Are math formulas formatted right?"
     "Does it follow our style guide?"

3. SMART VOTING SYSTEM
   - If 8 out of 10 specialists agree: "This is definitely an issue"
   - If 5 out of 10 agree: "This might be worth looking at"
   - If only 2 agree: "Probably fine, just FYI"

4. FRIENDLY TRANSLATOR
   Instead of: "ERROR: Violation of rule 7.2.1 on line 47"

   We say: "Students might find this concept jump challenging. Consider adding
   a stepping-stone example between your first and second examples."

5. AUTHOR FIXES ISSUES
   - They see issues ranked by importance
   - Each shows estimated fix time (5 min, 10 min, etc.)
   - Can ignore low-confidence suggestions
   - Rerun checks after making changes


================================================================================
WHAT AUTHORS WILL EXPERIENCE
================================================================================

BEFORE (Current Process):
Day 1: Submit module, cross fingers
Day 3: Get back list of 47 things wrong
Day 4: Try to fix everything, not sure what's most important
Day 5: Resubmit and wait again
Day 7: Finally approved (hopefully)

AFTER (With Our System):
9:00 AM: Submit module
9:05 AM: Get friendly feedback report
         - 3 critical issues (must fix)
         - 5 important suggestions (should fix)
         - 12 minor points (nice to have)
9:30 AM: Fix the critical issues
9:35 AM: Re-run just those checks - all pass!
10:00 AM: Address important suggestions
10:30 AM: Module ready for quick human review
11:00 AM: Approved and published

Time saved: 6 days → 2 hours


================================================================================
WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING (10 COMPONENTS)
================================================================================

1. THE FILING SYSTEM (30 minutes to build)
   What: Organizes all the feedback data
   Like: Creating a filing cabinet with proper folders and labels

2. THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL LOADER (45 minutes)
   What: Feeds our rules to each AI reviewer
   Like: Giving each inspector their specific checklist

3. THE TRAFFIC CONTROLLER (1 hour)
   What: Manages 60 reviewers working simultaneously
   Like: An air traffic controller managing many planes at once

4. THE VOTE COUNTER (1 hour)
   What: Tallies up which issues multiple reviewers agree on
   Like: Counting election ballots and finding the winners

5. THE FRIENDLY TRANSLATOR (45 minutes)
   What: Converts technical feedback into helpful suggestions
   Like: A translator making medical terms understandable

6. THE PROCESS MANAGER (1 hour)
   What: Runs the complete 4-pass review cycle
   Like: A factory supervisor managing an assembly line

7. THE QUALITY CHECKER (45 minutes)
   What: Tests that everything works correctly
   Like: Quality control in a factory

8. THE CONTROL PANEL (30 minutes)
   What: Settings and startup controls
   Like: The dashboard in your car

9. THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL (30 minutes)
   What: Documentation for users
   Like: The manual that comes with an appliance

10. THE HEALTH MONITOR (30 minutes)
    What: Checks that all systems are working
    Like: The check engine light in your car

Total Build Time: About 7 hours of programming


================================================================================
SAMPLE FEEDBACK COMPARISON
================================================================================

CURRENT HARSH FEEDBACK:
"ERROR: Paragraph 3 violates guideline 7.2.1. Missing concrete examples per
section 4 of the authoring guidelines. This is a CRITICAL issue that must be
resolved before publication."

OUR SUPPORTIVE FEEDBACK:
"Learning Opportunity (Paragraph 3): Your explanation of linear equations is
mathematically correct! To help students connect with this concept, consider
adding a real-world example. Maybe something like calculating the total cost
of movie tickets, where each ticket is $12 plus a $3 service fee?

Confidence: High (8/10 reviewers noticed this)
Estimated fix time: 5-10 minutes
Why this helps: Students studying alone need concrete examples to verify their
understanding."


================================================================================
THE MONEY PART
================================================================================

Cost Per Module Review:

OLD WAY:
- Human reviewer time: 3-4 hours
- At $50/hour: $150-200 per module
- Wait time: 2-3 days

NEW WAY:
- AI processing: $2-5 per module
- Human review time: 30-45 minutes
- At $50/hour: $25-38 per module
- Total: $27-43 per module
- Wait time: 5-10 minutes

SAVINGS: $123-157 per module (77% cost reduction)

If we process 100 modules per month:
- Monthly savings: $12,300 - $15,700
- Annual savings: $147,600 - $188,400


================================================================================
ADDRESSING CONCERNS
================================================================================

"Will this replace human reviewers?"
No. Humans still make all final decisions. This just helps them focus on
important judgments instead of hunting for commas.

"What if the AI makes mistakes?"
That's why we use 60 reviewers. When they disagree, we show low confidence.
Mistakes by one or two AIs get outvoted by the others.

"Will authors feel overwhelmed by 60 reviewers' feedback?"
No. New authors only see high-confidence issues. The system adapts to
experience level. Experienced authors can see everything if they want.

"Is this too expensive to run?"
It costs $2-5 per module but saves $123-157. That's a 30x return on investment.

"What if authors don't like it?"
It's optional. Authors can request traditional human-only review.

"Can we change the rules?"
Yes. All rules are in simple text files you can edit anytime. No programming
knowledge needed.
