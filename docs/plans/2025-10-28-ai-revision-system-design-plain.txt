LEARNVIA AI-POWERED CONTENT REVISION SYSTEM DESIGN
Date: October 28, 2025
Version: 1.0

====================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
====================================================

This document outlines the design for an AI-powered revision system for Learnvia educational modules. The system uses 60 AI reviewers in a structured consensus approach to reduce human reviewer workload by 70-80% while maintaining quality and empowering authors to improve their skills.

Core Philosophy: Empower authors through educational feedback aligned with product vision, rather than gatekeeping through pass/fail judgments.

====================================================
SYSTEM OVERVIEW
====================================================

KEY NUMBERS:
• Total AI Reviewers: 60 (30 for teaching quality, 30 for writing style)
• Review Rounds: 4 (2 for teaching, 2 for style)
• Author Revision Opportunities: 3 (after each round except the last)
• Target Efficiency: 70-80% reduction in human reviewer time
• Typical Module Size: About 5,000 words

WHAT GETS REVIEWED:
• Framing text (introduction)
• Main lesson content
• Mathematical examples
• Quiz questions with feedback
• Homework problems
(Note: Animations are reviewed separately)

====================================================
HOW IT WORKS: THE FOUR-PASS SYSTEM
====================================================

ROUND 1: TEACHING QUALITY (20 AI Reviewers)
----------------------------------------------------
What happens:
• 10 reviewers check if the module flows well for students
• 10 reviewers examine specific components (examples, quiz questions, etc.)
• All reviewers keep the "studying alone, low confidence" student in mind

Output:
• Report showing what needs improvement
• Each issue shows how many reviewers agreed (confidence score)
• Focus on helping students learn better

>>> AUTHOR REVISES BASED ON FEEDBACK <<<

ROUND 2: TEACHING QUALITY CHECK (10 AI Reviewers)
----------------------------------------------------
What happens:
• 5 fresh reviewers check if improvements were made
• 5 reviewers assess if module is ready for style review
• Adaptive focus based on how much was fixed

Output:
• Progress report with remaining issues
• Recommendation for moving forward

>>> AUTHOR REVISES AGAIN <<<

ROUND 3: STYLE AND FORMATTING (20 AI Reviewers)
----------------------------------------------------
What happens:
• 10 reviewers check grammar, formatting, and style guide compliance
• 10 reviewers examine component-specific style issues
• Focus shifts to mechanical improvements

Output:
• Style and formatting feedback
• Clear examples of what needs fixing

>>> AUTHOR MAKES FINAL REVISIONS <<<

ROUND 4: FINAL QUALITY CHECK (10 AI Reviewers)
----------------------------------------------------
What happens:
• 5 reviewers verify style improvements
• 5 reviewers provide overall assessment
• Final preparation for human review

Output:
• Final assessment for human reviewer
• Clear indication of any remaining issues

>>> MODULE GOES TO HUMAN REVIEWER <<<

====================================================
UNDERSTANDING CONFIDENCE SCORES
====================================================

When multiple AI reviewers look at the same content, they might agree or disagree on issues:

• 10 out of 10 reviewers flag something = Very High Confidence (definitely an issue)
• 7-9 out of 10 reviewers flag it = High Confidence (probably an issue)
• 4-6 out of 10 reviewers flag it = Moderate Confidence (worth considering)
• 2-3 out of 10 reviewers flag it = Low Confidence (optional to address)
• 1 out of 10 reviewers flags it = Very Low Confidence (noted but may be fine)

Important: Even single-reviewer issues are shown but marked as "low confidence"

====================================================
SEVERITY LEVELS: WHAT'S IMPORTANT?
====================================================

Level 5 - CRITICAL (Must Fix)
• Incorrect math
• Missing essential components
• Major misalignment with Learnvia's vision

Level 4 - HIGH (Important for Student Learning)
• Concepts too complex or poorly explained
• Missing examples students can relate to
• Lack of interaction or engagement

Level 3 - MEDIUM (Writing Quality)
• Using different words for the same concept
• Sentences too complex
• Vague explanations

Level 2 - LOW (Style Guide)
• Grammar issues
• Formatting problems
• Minor punctuation

Level 1 - MINOR (Polish)
• Word choice improvements
• Slightly verbose sections

====================================================
FEEDBACK PHILOSOPHY: SUPPORTING AUTHORS
====================================================

INSTEAD OF: "ERROR: Your explanation jumps too quickly from basic to advanced"

WE SAY: "Learning Opportunity: Students might struggle with the jump from basic to advanced concepts here. Consider adding an intermediate example to help them bridge the gap."

EVERY REPORT INCLUDES:
• What you did well (strengths)
• What to fix first (priorities)
• How long revisions might take (time estimate)
• Where to learn more (resource links)
• Ability to explain why you disagree (dispute option)

====================================================
ADAPTING TO AUTHOR EXPERIENCE
====================================================

FOR NEW AUTHORS:
• Only see the most important issues at first
• Get extra explanation and context
• Receive encouragement about strengths
• Access to "common challenges" guide

FOR EXPERIENCED AUTHORS:
• See all feedback
• Can quickly dismiss low-confidence items
• Get advanced insights
• Streamlined presentation

====================================================
THE HUMAN REVIEWER'S ROLE
====================================================

After all 60 AI reviewers have processed the module:
• Human sees comprehensive pre-analysis
• Clear focus areas based on AI assessment
• Handles disputes where authors disagree
• Makes final approval decision
• Identifies patterns for system improvement

====================================================
SUCCESS METRICS
====================================================

PRIMARY GOALS:
• Reduce human reviewer time by 70-80%
• Maintain current quality standards
• Help authors improve their skills over time
• Reduce author turnover through better support

WHAT WE TRACK:
• How well AI findings match human reviews
• How quickly authors can revise successfully
• Dispute rates and resolutions
• Author retention and success rates

====================================================
KEY INNOVATION
====================================================

The system's power comes from combining:

1. MANY REVIEWERS (60 total) for comprehensive coverage
2. CONSENSUS SCORING to reduce false positives
3. EDUCATIONAL FRAMING to empower rather than criticize
4. ADAPTIVE PRESENTATION based on author experience
5. PRODUCT VISION ALIGNMENT throughout all reviews

====================================================
SUMMARY FOR LEADERSHIP
====================================================

This system transforms the revision process from a bottleneck into a learning opportunity. Authors get comprehensive, supportive feedback that helps them improve while reducing the burden on human reviewers.

The key is using AI not to replace human judgment but to prepare and organize the review process so humans can focus on high-value mentoring and edge cases rather than routine compliance checking.

By investing in author development through better feedback, Learnvia can build a stronger content team while maintaining high standards for the non-traditional learners you serve.
