1. Introduction
Overview
Great teaching plus great courseware gives students the best chance for success.


Great teaching may involve teachers carrying out various evidence-based teaching practices, such as facilitating active group learning, helping students improve their metacognitive skills, fostering a sense of belonging among students, and more.


Great courseware supports teachers and students by enabling students to learn before and after class, and even during class. Traditional instructional support materials have included textbooks, homework exercises, solutions manuals, presentation slides, discussion forums, and more. 


The word “courseware” is a combo of “course” and “software,” alluding to the fact that such supporting materials are increasingly available as software.


This document describes a “vision” of courseware under development by the new non-profit organization Learnvia, funded by the Gates Foundation, and in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), world leaders in cognitive and learning science. The document is primarily to orient and guide people contributing to the courseware’s development, describing key features and their underlying rationale.
A key goal of the project is to improve the success rates of students in college gateway math courses, such as calculus, precalculus, and quantitative reasoning by improving access to high quality digital materials and resources that are known to improve student learning and instructor practice. Special focus is on embedding learning science and learning engineering principles to eliminate learning and success disparities that exist for Black, Latino, and Indigenous students, and for students from low-income backgrounds – collectively referred to as our “focus students.” For example, data from 2019 shows DFW rates of 35% on average, and 48% for Black and Latino students. Our goal is to reduce that 35% rate, and to shrink that disparity as well. For STEM (science/technology/engineering/math) majors, a broader goal is retention of students in STEM. The aim is to converge innovation across curriculum, pedagogy, technology, and research to deliver more effective math instruction and improved student learning that will yield our target goals of reduced DFWs and higher STEM degree retention.
Context
The courseware is intended to be used with a college-level course. The courseware implements nearly all supporting materials of a course: textbook, homework, solutions manual, discussion forum, presentation slides, summative assessment. The courseware is specifically NOT a supplement to a textbook, and likewise should not be supplemented with a separate homework system; a student experience that involves disparate tools/systems can lead to inconsistent learning experiences, login trouble, excessive learning curves, and more. Instead, the courseware is intended to be a “one-stop shop”, involving a clean simple integration of everything a course needs beyond the instructor, class time, and learning management system. The intuitive courseware design will eliminate the need for up-front user training on the platform. Although the courseware's content may be printable in some form, the courseware's primary usage is digital due to extensive dynamic and interactive features. 


The courseware is designed primarily for a “traditional” college class that lasts one term (e.g., semester lasting about 14-16 weeks, quarter lasting about 10 weeks, summer term lasting 4-5 weeks, etc.), and that meets synchronously (either in-person or online). The courseware can also be used very effectively for asynchronous online courses.


The courseware ideally complements a good teacher/classroom experience. But the courseware should enable all students to learn all the material the best as possible, for any teacher/classroom experience. The courseware aims not to replace instructors, but rather to aid instructors in their goals and improve the quality of human-to-human time. 


The courseware aims to teach not just the skills, but also the concepts of a topic, and even the more general ideas of how to think and to solve problems. Of course, a good teacher/classroom experience greatly aids these latter items that go beyond skills, but the courseware does what it can. 
Product 
(Copy to/from DETL Story if updated). 
The courseware, consisting of a software platform plus content (“courseware” comes from course + software), is being developed from the ground up. Specifically, it is not based on a previous courseware platform nor previous content.  


Such ground up development of the software platform:  
* Enables use of state-of-the-art technologies and a high degree of innovation, which may yield a strong feature set, stability, scalability, and modern authoring too 
* May yield faster development due to not having to integrate with an existing platform, or to learn/match an existing platform’s software and its patterns. 
* Has a tradeoff of longer initial time-to-market, but given our timeline, this was not a substantial issue.  
* Benefits from prior experience of team members who have been intricately involved with other modern successful courseware projects, in particular zyBooks (a leading provider of courseware in Computer Science and related fields), and CMU’s OLI/Torus (a leading provider of OER courseware).  


Such ground up development of the content:  
* Allows an obsessive focus on student learning. In contrast, many leading publishers have focused largely on instructor satisfaction of topic coverage and resources – also important, but this project puts student learning as the top priority.  
* Enables the content to closely match the platform’s capabilities, such as video with embedded questions, graphical calculators, AI-graded long answer questions, etc. In contrast, many courseware offerings today from major publishers or OER are based on textbooks, which were written for paper and thus focused on lengthy text and static figures, rather than interactive learning.  


Below is a summary of key features.  
* Platform 
   * Cloud-based 
      * Eliminates software installation hurdles for students and instructors. 
   * Mobile-first design 
      * Recognizes that many students, especially our focus students, do a substantial amount of course work on their mobile devices. 
   * LMS integrated 
      * Eases instructor and student workflows. 
   * Has nearly all features outside class time:  
      * Lessons (before class, or for missed classes), homework, quizzes, all auto-graded. Discussion forum, AI tutor, AI coach, note taking, and more.  
   * All such features seamlessly integrated in a single system 
      * Eliminates common problems with disjointed, inconsistent systems 
   * Built-in help via discussion forum and AI tutor        
      * Enables more students to get help, when needed, and anonymously if desired. 
   * Makes use of modern AI for various features
      * Auto-grading of long-answer questions, AI-driven tutoring, automated summaries of student performance, etc.
   * Instrumented for research 
      * Ensures courseware achieves its student success goals 
   * Easy user feedback capability 
      * Allows publisher to quickly address issues 
   * Optimized for ease of use by students 
      * Eliminates most-common student complaint of courseware. 
   * Configurable/Customizable 
      * Instructors can rearrange modules (reorder, remove, group into chapters), and set modules as optional. They can insert notes for students throughout. In the future, they can write their own module content to supplement our authored content.  
   * Emphasizes ease of use, for both students and instructors
      * Tool complexity is a common problem in education technology offerings.
   * Requires no up-front training for students or instructors
      * Though the courseware may provide some just-in-time recommended tutorials. 
   * Captures a student’s activity, which translates into part of a course’s grade.
      * Extensive data logging of student interaction facilitates learning science research and iterative platform/content improvement.


* Content 
   * Chunked
      * Lessons are 5-10 min activities, about 3-5 per module
   * Scaffolded 
      * Lessons, homeworks, and quizzes all build slowly
   * Aligned
      * Uses backwards design
      * So lesson questions build to homeworks, which build to quizzes, which build to exams
   * Lessons obsessively concise and clear 
      * Animated figures (videos) built with great attention
      * “Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage - to move in the opposite direction.” --Albert Einstein 
   * Homework problems are auto-generated, with support 
      * Hints, auto-grading, solutions, and unlimited opportunities. 
      * Gives students as much practice as desired, with scaffolding.  
   * Practice quizzes auto-generated/graded 
      * Allows students to know how they will do on “real” quiz/exam, with pointers to lessons/homework to strengthen in needed areas.  
   * End-of-module/chapter review/practice customized to  each student 
      * Adapts to student needs to efficiently strengthen in needed areas. 
   * Built-in prerequisite content 
      * Helps students with less prior knowledge. Also supports forward-placement of students, known to improve overall success.  
   * Supports traditional and growth-oriented summative assessment approaches (e.g., proficiency-based testing, re-testing options, etc.) 


* Student development 
   * Built-in AI coach 
      * Provides meta-cognitive support, encouragement, advice, scheduling support, reminders, and more. 
  
* Instructor development (“PD”) 
* Defaults encourage best teaching practices, such as:  
* One chapter/week with recurring pattern, active classrooms with pre-class lessons, extensive summative/formative feedback via lessons’ learning questions, homeworks, practice quizzes, extensive help via forum and AI tutor, and more. 
* Instructors benefit from education research without having to thoroughly study field or figure out how to incorporate methods 
* Built-in student surveys with analysis and customized lessons to instructors 
* Shown to improve class culture, yielding more student success 
* Built-in community of practice support via discussion forum with instructor community 
* Decreases “loneliness” of teaching, supports exchange of ideas and camaraderie 
* Built-in additional PD opportunities 


* AI is transforming many things. We expect to use AI in various ways:  
   * Point solutions 
      * Chatbots: tutor, student coach (including metacognition), instructor coach (including PD), ... 
      * Auto-grader:  long-answer responses, series of equations, handwritten equations, hand-drawn plots, spoken English responses, ... 
      * Assessment generator: Creating quizzes (of varying length/difficulty), exams. Quality assurance for instructor-created items (accuracy, coverage), ... 
      * Content generator: Video/audio/animations from scripts, text, alt-text, exercises, instructor items like syllabus/rubric/worksheets, ... 
      * Analyzer: Summarizer of tutor/coach sessions, common mistakes, poll responses, long-answer questions, exam results, class performance, ... 
   * Adaptivity 
      * Assessing student knowledge, generating just-in-time lessons, offering pre-requisite support, adjusting assessments based on performance, ... 
   * Comprehensive oversight 
      * Looking across all activities by a student – lessons, exams, discussions, tutor/coach sessions, etc., and providing summary/insights/suggestions in response 
      * Looking across entire class's activities and providing  summary/insights/suggestions 
      * Looking across all courseware users and detecting trends, assisting in research trials, suggesting/making improvements 
Usage
Every class gets a unique courseware subject instance.
* A "course” is a subject in a university’s course catalog, like “Calculus 1” at Univ XYZ.
* A “class” is an instance of that course, such as Calculus 1 taught Fall 2024 at Univ XYZ. A class might have class sections, such as Sec 1 at 8:00am, Sec 2 at 9:00am, etc. A class section might have multiple lectures per week, such as Tuesday at 8:00am and Thursday at 8:00am. It is recommended to always include “class” before “section” to avoid confusion with sections of a textbook.
* A “courseware subject” is an authored courseware intended to cover a common course’s topics, such as Calculus 1. A library of courseware subjects may exist, such as Precalculus, Calculus 1, and Calculus 2.
* A “courseware instance” is a clone of a courseware subject (e.g., Calculus 1) that specifically supports a class. It may have a unique identifying code, such as “Calc1Fall2024UnivXYZ”. It is accessed only by students enrolled in the class, with a roster provided by the LMS perhaps, or by the instructor. Instructors can configure their courseware instance, including moving content and writing some of their own content within limits.
   * A courseware instance may combine courseware subjects, such as combining Precalculus and Calculus 1, or Calculus 1 and Calculus 2.
   *  A courseware instance is based on a courseware subject version, such as “Calculus 1, version 3”. The instance’s version will not change during a term, but instructors may be required to use the latest version in a subsequent term. Small changes to versions may be made during a term, deemed by authors to not disrupt the term, such as small error corrections. But later versions may involve bigger chances, such as splitting a module into two, or adding new modules to a chapter.
   * A new courseware instance is generated from an existing courseware instance, either the catalog courseware subject version instance, or an instructor’s instance from a previous academic term. Instances generated from a previous courseware instance should merge courseware subject version updates with instructor customizations. That instance is based on a “release” of the courseware subject. Releases may be made roughly every 6 months, or less frequently.


The courseware’s interface should be simple; too many edtech products have a large usage learning curve. Simplicity means every page should focus on the task at hand, with minimal distracting items.
Furthermore, the interface should focus on the TOC and content as outlined in greater detail elsewhere in this doc.
* An analogy is YouTube. Users first see a list of videos and search bar, and then one click leads directly to the user watching a video.
* In the courseware, users first see a list of content (TOC), and then one click leads directly to the user learning in a module’s activity.
* More advanced features surely exist, such as viewing analytics, editing one’s profile, etc., but like YouTube, such features require extra steps to access and are not emphasized in the UI/UX.


2. Content structure
This section discusses structural aspects of the courseware content. Discussion of curriculum is in the Learnvia Authoring Guidelines.
Hierarchy


KEY FEATURE: Course content follows this hierarchy: 
* Chapter
   * Module: About 50 min, 2-4 learning outcomes, at least 4 KSAs. 
      * Activity: About 5 per module, about 10 min each
         * Task: 2-3/activity (e.g., video, question set)


These values are rough targets, with moderate variation expected (e.g., Module time 40-60 min). 


An activity is one of three kinds: 
* Lesson activity: Introduces students to ideas and skills. Auto-scored, not randomized.
* Homework activity: Gives students practice. Auto-scored, randomized. 
* Quiz activity: Assesses student understanding, ranging from no stakes to high stakes. Auto-scored, randomized. 
A "normal" module has 3-4 lesson activities, 1 homework activity, and 1 quiz activity, each about 10 min. Homework may be slightly above 10 min, quizzes slightly below 10 min. 


This hierarchy, where each activity is about 10 min, provides learning in bite-sized pieces (aka chunking) to match student lives where study may be interrupted or occur in fragments like 30 min. The model also provides transparency to assist students with planning, and to assist instructors when configuring content. Ex: 5 lesson activities is about 50 min of student work, 2 homework activities is about 20 min, 4 modules is just over 3 hours (200 min). Authors may need to split or group activities or modules to match the model.  


Our library will provide two kinds of configurations into chapters: 
* "Catalog" configuration: A catalog configuration has traditional chapters per coarse-grained subject, such as 5 chapters for a Calculus 1 course (15-20 modules/chapter). Ideally we would only provide weekly configurations, but Instructors are accustomed to such a catalog configuration when reviewing material.
* "Weekly" configuration: We will provide configurations that distribute modules so each chapter is one week matching a typical class syllabus, such as a 14-week config, to support a nice recurring weekly pattern for students. This is usually the configuration that instructors will "adopt" as a starting point for their course. For a 4-unit course that is expected (per the Carnegie Unit system) to have about 4 hours of class time and 8 hours (480 min) of out-of-class study time, then a week's chapter might have about 480 min * (1 module)/(50 min) = 9-10 modules. 


In a weekly configuration, a chapter's module structure might look as follows, where each chapter is a week. Word "activity" omitted for brevity; Qs means questions. 
* Chapter
   * Module 1: Title (typically motivation/intuition)
      * Lesson
      * Lesson
      * Lesson
      * Summary/review (auto-generated)
   * Module 2: Title
      * Lesson
      * Lesson
      * Lesson
      * Homework Qs
      * Practice-quiz Qs
      * Summary/review
   * Module 3: Title
      * Lesson
      * Lesson
      * Lesson
      * Lesson
      * Summary/review
      * Homework Qs
      * Practice-quiz Qs
   * ...
   * Module 7: Chapter summary" (auto-generated)
      * Lesson (chapter review)
      * Lesson (growth opportunities from module (optional))
      * Lesson (background info growth opportunities (optional))


Every activity has interactive resources, like videos or questions, with associated points. Everything is auto-scored (no human grading required). The three activities have incrementally increasing scoring criteria: 
* Lessons: Everyone gets 100% of points for participating. For questions, students can request the answer (with explanation), which they can then enter for their points. 
* Homework: Everyone can get 100% of points, but must answer correctly on their own. For questions, they can again request the answer (with explanation), but then get another randomized question to answer themselves. Unlimited attempts. 
* Quiz: These assess student knowledge, so students cannot request the answer. Instead, student enters answers, then submits to see correctness and score. 


By default, the content will include "practice-quizzes" (no-stakes). Instructors may later instantiate with-stakes quizzes. For practice-quizzes, score is based just on attempt (hence the "practice" word), with correctness shown too. For with-stakes ("normal") quizzes, score is based on correctness. 


In textbook lingo, modules are like sections, lesson activities like subsections, and homework like end-of-section exercises. We use the word modules rather than sections to avoid confusion between content sections and class sections, which both exist in the courseware.  KSAs (Knowledge/Skill/Ability) are the basic knowledge components being learned, invisible to students; instead, modules have 2-4 learning outcomes visible to students/instructors. 


Each authored module:
* Has associated learning outcomes (LOs) (2–4/module) and 3-8 KSAs 
* Acts as an atomic unit
   * Instructors will also be able to create their own modules to supplement authored modules, or bring in a module from other courses (e.g., mix precalculus and calculus). 
* Has a list of prerequisite modules (dependencies). 
   * If an instructor's configuration violates a dependency, the system warns the instructor. 
* May include a "prerequisite" lesson that provides background info (optional, but could be required for students taking the course "with support"). 
* Has about 3-4 lesson activities. A common pattern is an intro lesson, a core lesson, and an example lesson, as found in a textbook section's subsections. 
* Usually ends with a homework activity, perhaps 3-5 questions.
* Usually ends with a practice-quiz activity (after the homework activity), perhaps 3-5 questions.
* The system redundantly auto-generates end-of-chapter homework and quiz activities comprised of all such homework and practice-quiz questions; students can complete questions in either location. 


Each activity:
* Relates to its parent module's learning outcomes. Tagging activities with learning outcomes enables the courseware to track student success.
* Has resources tagged with KSAs, used to calculate the student’s competency level for each KSA and thus the learning outcomes too (as KSA map to learning outcomes).
* Most lesson activities:
   * Start with brief framing text, just a couple sentences. 
   * Teaches via an animated figure with a few simple embedded questions, but sometimes via a static figure, table, or text. 
* Then teaches more via follow-up questions, including multiple choice, short answer, and long answer. MC and SA may include justification. Additional question types include multi-step problems, matching, and fill-in. 


The courseware will also include an auto-generated Glossary of terms pulled from the definitions throughout the authored content.  Students will have access to these definitions in the glossary, in activity content, and through content search.  The AI Tutor will also have access to these definitions and can be prompted to provide or volunteer them during an interaction with a student.
Lesson activities marked "in-class"
The content is comprehensive, meaning in principle a student might achieve all learning outcomes from the content. In practice, the best situation is the content complements a great teacher and in-class learning. As such, an instructor can mark any lesson activity as "in-class," causing the platform to provide an alternative means for getting credit for that lesson, like checking an "I attended class" box, or that lesson may simply become "optional" for students. 
 
To support active classes, authors may add suggested in-class activities for lessons likely to be covered in class. Such in-class activities might include hard multiple-choice/short-answer problems that students work on in groups and then discuss with the class, perhaps in the courseware or perhaps while at whiteboards. Or they might include longer problems that students work on together on a whiteboard.  (3/1/25 FV These will be added in a later authoring pass). 
Configurability


Even if we provide a weekly configuration, instructors want the ability to configure their courseware instance to best match their course. Modules are the atomic unit. Instructors can:
* Move modules among chapters
* Remove/hide modules
* Name chapters
* Set modules as “Optional”
* Supplement with a few instructor-authored modules


As modules are atomic, activities within publisher-authored modules are constrained in that they cannot be created, deleted, renamed, moved, or made optional (for lessons). This constraint gives authors needed assurances that certain topics will be covered and in a particular order. However, instructors can make the following customizations within a module: 
* Set a lesson to be "in-class". The platform automatically makes this lesson optional, but still provides a way for students to get points for that lesson if they attended class.  
* Set a homework or practice-quiz activity to be optional. Not all instructors necessarily want to use our homework or practice-quiz system. 
* Insert instructor's notes throughout.


A module has a list of dependencies on prerequisite modules. During configuration, dependency violations should be noted to instructors. To support this, every module should have an internal short unique meaningful name, such as “LimitDefinition” or “IntroToDerivatives”, so other modules may use that name in listing dependencies.


Modules have learning outcomes, which can support future approaches that check if a configuration covers all course learning outcomes (where each outcome is dependent on some KSAs), and approaches that generate quizzes automatically for a set of modules.
Weekly configuration
Matching the syllabus 
Instructors provide students with a syllabus, which typically provides a weekly list of topics covered. Textbooks typically group topics into chapters based solely on the topic. Furthermore, instructors often skip some modules, list some modules as optional, and cover some modules in a different order. As such, students are immediately faced with a less-than-simple view of their course term, as in:
* Week 1 – Intro, Functions: Smith 1.1-1.8, 2.1-2.3
* Week 2 – More functions: Smith 2.4-2.6, 2.8-2.10, 7.1-7.2, 2.11 (optional)


As digital products are configurable, the courseware modules can be moved so that the courseware table of contents (TOC) exactly matches the syllabus, leading to:
* Week 1 – Intro, Functions
* Week 2 – More functions


Weekly configuration should be strongly encouraged by the courseware, including providing a default configuration for common semester syllabi, e.g., a 14-week configuration, and supporting weekly recurring assignments.
Weekly recurring assignments
Instructors typically provide “assignments” to students, and LMS’s typically have an “assignment system” to list and accept those assignments. A term may have 20, 30, or more such assignments, as in:
*  Assignment 1: Do 1.1-1.8 reading lessons by 10 pm on date X
*  Assignment 2: Do 1.8’s homework exercises 1, 2, 5, 9 by 10 pm on date Y
*  (LONG list of assignments omitted)
* Assignment 45: Do 8.1-8.5 reading lessons by 10 pm on date Z


Instead, with a weekly configuration in the courseware, students can simply be given a recurring pattern:
* Weekly: Lessons due Tue, homework Thu, and quizzes Sun. All by 10 pm. 
* For a 14-week course, that simple pattern easily yields 14*3 = 42 assignments.
* If an instructor provides a start date, all 42 assignments' due dates fill automatically. 


The courseware should encourage a weekly configuration among instructors. Initially, 14-week and 10-week configurations will be made available, which instructors can use as-is or reconfigure to match their course.


Likewise, the courseware should make it easy for instructors to create a recurring assignment pattern and illustrate that pattern using a TOC schema. Below is an early conceptual prototype.
  

The instructor selects a term start date and the weekday for each assignment type across the top, which auto-updates each week's dates. Variations can exist on the above (e.g., two weekly due dates for lessons), and exceptions too (e.g., changes during the first week, or during a week with a Monday holiday). Traditional assignments should be supported too, but the recurring-pattern approach to assignments should be heavily encouraged by the courseware.


Compare the above to a normal list of assignments in Canvas shown below, of which there would be 15 for the above 5 weeks. For students, the above recurring pattern provides a clear pattern and improves a course's transparency. It also reduces instructor work and chances for erroneous dates. 


  

	  

	



3. Content curriculum vision
This section describes the high-level vision of WHAT will be authored. A separate document, Authoring Guidelines (see link at top of this doc), describes more details and emphasizes HOW to author. 


Key is that our content is well:
* Chunked: Broken into bite-sized pieces (modules, activities) with known durations for each. 
* Scaffolded: Teaches one thing at a time, from simpler to harder, building up
* Aligned: Lessons lead to homework, which lead to quizzes, which lead to exams (if present).
Modules in a chapter (weekly configuration)
In a weekly configuration, each chapter has these modules: 
* Motivation/intuition module: Chapter starts with a motivation/intuition module; The first module of every chapter consists of 1-2 motivation lesson activities and 1–2 intuition activities.
   * A motivation lesson tells the student why they’re studying a subject. 
   * An intuition lesson provides insight into what the student is about to learn so the learning can be attached to an experience.
* Core modules: Most chapter modules teach concepts via author-created lessons, homework, and quizzes. 
   * Scaffolded so no student gets lost due to large jumps. See below. 
   * Common pattern: 
      * Intro lesson -- motivating example, overview of problem, intuitive experience (known as "anchoring")
      * Core lesson(s) -- the main concept being taught
      * Expansion lesson -- Expanding on the core: Perhaps more complex concepts, or a detailed walk-through example
      * Homework questions
      * Practice quiz questions
* Exploration module: Chapter has a second-to-last module that is an “Exploration” module whose lessons show interesting real-world applications involving the chapter’s topic. Not every week may have this; perhaps every 2-3 weeks. 
* Summary/review module: Chapter has an auto-generated module with:
   * A summary lesson auto generated from the chapter’s modules that:
      * Works regardless of configuration, so is derived from authored summary points per module, or perhaps via AI.
         * Is still active, e.g., skeletal notes, questions.
   *  An adaptive review: See “Adaptivity” in this doc for additional details.
   * An activity with a redundant view of all homework questions from the chapter’s modules
   * An activity with a redundant view of all practice-quiz questions from the chapter’s modules. 


The authoring guidelines provide more info. 


Scaffolding
Student struggle is commonly due to content or instructors taking big jumps. “Scaffolding” designs content so a student “climbs up knowledge steps” without big jumps, like climbing up scaffolding of a building. The courseware scaffolds via incremental activities comprising three general steps. 


* Lessons
   * What
      * The "teaching" or "explanation" step of introducing a new concept
      * Like a tutor explaining to a student
      * Includes videos/text but also questions; a good tutor doesn't just lecture. 
   * Difficulty
      * Questions are answerable in one's head in seconds, without pencil or calculator (or rare and brief). 
      * Start simple and get a little harder. 
   * Support
      * Full support, meaning hints, answer, and explanation available. 
   * Where
      * Embedded in videos, to check student is following. VERY simple and quick, and at most a couple per video. 
      * As follow-up to video (or other item). Still simple/quick, but can start to be more challenging. 
   * Style
      * Embedded: Multiple choice or short answer. 
      * Follow-up: Mostly multiple choice or short answer. May themselves be scaffolded (multi-part). May include one AI-graded long answer Q (obviously not answerable in one's head). 


* Homeworks
   * What
      * The "practice" step of learning a concept 
      * Like a tutor saying "Now you try it". 
   * Difficulty
      * Some questions answerable in head, but some require pencil/calculator. 
   * Support
      * Nearly full support, meaning hints, answer, and explanation available. But if answer given, then student gets new randomized problem. Unlimited attempts. 
   * Style
      * Mostly short answer or long answer. Multiple choice rare. 


* Quizzes
   * What
      * The "assess student knowledge" step of learning
   * Difficulty
      * Similar to homework activities, some even harder
   * Support
      * Little support, maybe hints. Student completes all questions, submits to see correctness and score. 
      * Future: Unlimited practice. Retake opportunities. Varying stakes. Much more. 
   * Style
      * Mix of multiple choice, short answer, long answer. 


Alignment
The above items are created using “backwards design” to create aligned content: 
* Authors first define course learning outcomes (~20 for course), module learning outcomes (2-4 per module), and fine-grained Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) for each outcome (100s for course). 
* Authors create “exam worthy” questions to assess KSAs and learning outcomes, then create quiz questions that provide practice for exam-worthy questions, then homework questions that build towards quizzes, then lessons with learning questions that build towards homeworks.
As such, lessons stay focused and avoid tangents, and homeworks avoid being "busy-work". Ideally, such alignment is made explicit to students, showing for example how homework problems relate to exam questions (by topic, and by student outcome data). 


In short, no student should be surprised upon taking a higher-stakes assessment, because they would have done questions in lessons (with full support), then built up to homework (with nearly full support), and may have even taken practice quizzes. Such alignment should reduce the common student complaint that lectures and homework didn’t prepare them for exams. Students should have an accurate estimate of how they will do on a quiz or exam, and if unhappy should be allowed more practice until ready.
KSAs
The courseware will use Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs) as the foundation for learning determination. 
* A course map will show the relationship between chapters, modules, lessons, and KSAs.
* Each lesson will likely have more than one relevant KSA assigned by the authors. These are not student-facing and can be used more than once/as many times as relevant for a module. The KSAs to lesson relationship will be many to many.
* Authors will tag questions with a primary KSA.
* Authors will also create broader module-level learning outcomes that reflect the KSAs covered in the module and could be displayed to students, as well as instructors.


One use of the KSAs is to ascertain a student’s learning. A student correctly answering a question covering a particular KSA, contributes to a conclusion that the student has learned that node’s KSAs and outcomes. Different competency levels may be defined per KSA based on the number of correctly answered questions covering that KSA. Potentially, KSAs may be assembled into a knowledge graph, but the feasibility and utility of such a graph remains to be seen. 
Summative assessment approach
The courseware should support common summative assessment patterns, such as midterms/final, or weekly quizzes.


One goal set by the courseware designers is to create an “uber exam” that has auto-generated auto-graded final-exam-worthy questions that cover every KSA and course learning outcome. Then assessments throughout the courseware for low-stake quizzes or higher stakes midterm and final exams could be created by selecting questions from the uber exam.


Some research suggests that students benefit from:
* Multiple lower-stakes assessments vs. a few higher-stakes assessments
* Opportunities to take practice assessments
* Retake opportunities if unhappy with a score or if not demonstrating competency/proficiency


As such, the courseware should support and encourage such approaches. The default configuration may involve weekly quizzes, each with a no-stakes practice assessment that can be taken unlimited times. Retake opportunities per assessment, or a proficiency-based approach (many attempts, even unlimited, with later or no deadlines), may be considered.


As of early 2025, an investment is under development with PrairieLearn / Univ. Of Illinois to help develop the uber exam by randomizing static exam questions we will provide, and to research impacts of different assessment approaches on student attitudes and success. 


Authoring team approach
Learnvia's approach to authoring teams for gateway courses differs from traditional college textbook publishing. 


Publishers traditionally produce textbooks as largely-independent projects. Each book may be led by one or a few authors, who develop the approach to covering the subject, the pedagogy, and more, and whose names are marqueed. Different books may use very different pedagogies, terminology, formatting, etc. Publishers may even produce several books on a topic and see which wins. 


Learnvia's approach differs from traditional, aiming to develop a strong learning experience in a highly consistent manner. The consistency relates to how content is chunked, scaffolded, and aligned, seeking to maximize learning and student success in a course. The consistency enables mix-and-matching of subjects, such as a combined quantitative reasoning and precalculus product, or a combined physics and calculus product. That consistency allows for generation of data that drives research and that feeds into processes that continually improve the content based on research, and it enables an internal team to work across all content titles seamlessly. That consistency may enable scaling up content production via more authors, and even using AI to help generate, review, and improve content. Beyond consistency, Learnvia's authoring also differs from traditional by creating content for a highly-interactive (and evolving) platform, supporting lessons, homeworks, and quizzes (the latter two highly randomized) in a tightly-aligned manner -- a very different authoring experience from creating a paper textbook or series of video lectures. 


To support this approach, Learnvia authors go through extensive ongoing training to follow a thorough set of authoring guidelines. Authors need both a willingness and talent for creating such content. Learnvia authors work with large teams, perhaps with some focusing on lessons, some homeworks, some on quizzes, some reviewing, some tool building, and more, with extensive collaboration necessary, and rotating among duties -- very different from traditional authoring. Of course, one or a few authors may serve as lead visionaries for a project, but they still operate as part of a larger team. Due to the team approach, Learnvia author names are not marqueed (though contributors may be acknowledged in preface material); the content is associated with Learnvia approach, not with a particular few authors. Authors may be paid to create content, but no royalties are paid, especially because content may be mixed-and-matched, and because content will be modified over time by any of multiple people.


We also intend to just have one courseware offering per subject, so we can put our efforts into making that offering the very best. The hope is that with configurability, we can address different needs of the market, such as early vs late transcendentals in calculus 1, or calculus/statistics targeting engineers vs life sciences vs. business. 
4. Platform basics
Table of contents (TOC) orientation
Educational technology (aka edtech) products often confuse users (students and instructors) who cannot “see” all the paths, features, and other items available to them. This often leads to users not knowing what to do next, underutilizing key features, and/or getting lost in the navigation.
For ease of use, a principle of this courseware is to stick closely to the “schema” of a textbook, which users already know. Users know a textbook has a table of contents (TOC), with main topics called “chapters”, and sub-topics called “sections” or “modules”. Users know a course typically progresses sequentially through that content, perhaps covering a chapter every week or two.
An analogy schema involves restaurants. Upon entering a fast-food chain restaurant, people know a lot – proceed to a counter at the front, read the large menu above the counter, place order, select table, and get food in about 5 min when your name/number is called. People even intuitively know the bathrooms are to the back right (because the drive thru is on the left). In contrast, walking into a regular restaurant, questions arise. Seat yourself or wait to be seated? What’s on the menu? How long will this take? And finding the bathrooms is often its own adventure. The restaurant analogy breaks down in that our courseware is not the dining equivalent of “fast food,” but helps appreciate the schema benefit.
TOC orientation is important not only during use, but also for adoption: Instructors are more likely to replace a textbook with something that clearly has the same coverage as a textbook and can be sequenced through like a textbook.
Thus, the courseware’s content should be organized as a TOC, and the courseware’s main entry point should be through a TOC intentionally looking similar to a textbook’s TOC. Below is a sample depiction, where “Week 1: Introduction to Derivatives” is the first chapter, “Week 2...” the second, etc. (The example below is an early conceptual prototype)
  

Math Platform UX designs for the TOC with the platform style guidelines and additional design considerations included: Additional iterations and views can be found in the project figma.


Desktop View
  

Mobile View
  

Although not shown, a clear indicator of where the user left off should be present, so users can quickly resume learning, as students today often do bursts of work as time is available, e.g., during 15 min between classes, or on a 20-min bus ride, etc.
TOC: Transparency & Schema Overlays
Because the TOC schema is so well known and is the courseware’s main entry point, the courseware should overlay features on the TOC to the extent possible, rather than creating custom views for each feature. 
Week-based organization with a recurring work pattern, greatly aids in making the class section structure “transparent” to students especially when overlaid with the due dates for course activities. (Details on the instructor configuration of the course is covered in the next section.)  
The TOC overlay approach:
* Keeps the number of “objects” that a user must learn to a minimum, taking advantage of the well-understood TOC schema.
* Ensures that info is presented in a context relevant to students.
Search
Students and Instructor use search to find topics or types of resources in the courseware
* Traditional products typically match on any text, and don’t show results in order of appearance or sorted by best match.
* Instead, the courseware’s search should filter and expand the TOC.
* Ex: Searching for “derivative” might filter the TOC to only show modules within their parent chapters that contain the word derivative. Perhaps the TOC will shrink to show just chapters 2 and 3, a few modules under each, and an expansion to show what items match within each module, such as a video caption, and an activity title.
* If searching for “derivative”, a student early in a term can easily focus on matches in the earlier chapters.
* Search should allow users to select the kinds of items to match: Resource captions (e.g., a video or figure caption), paragraph text, step captions within a video, question text, etc.
* Search should allow simple filtering/expansions of the TOC without a search term. Ex: A user can show all videos, causing filtering to only show modules with videos, and a list of video captions under each module. 
Student’s own analytics 
Students want to know data related to their learning.
* Traditional products take students to a separate page for analytics
* Instead, the courseware should overlay such data on the TOC, showing chapter completion, module completion, and even activity completion if requested.
* Other data, such as time spent, items most struggled on, effort measures, or proficiency measures, should upon request be overlayed on the TOC as well (replacing completion data).
Due Dates
Students want to know what assignments are upcoming, and when they are due.
* Traditional products have yet another page showing due dates
* Instead, the courseware should overlay due dates on the TOC..
Note: Education technology products often focus almost exclusively on upcoming due dates, without a TOC perspective nor a recurring pattern perspective. They may just present the student with what item is due and that item’s points and take them straight to those items. Instead, the courseware should strive to seek a balance between focusing on what is due vs. helping students enjoy their learning. The former is like telling employees “This meeting is required, and you are being paid $X” while the latter is like having more focus on the goals and quality of the meeting.
The product aims to accomplish this balance by providing two views of content: 
* A typical "Topics-ordered" view
* A "Due-date" ordered view
For example: 
Topic ordered: 
1.1
   1.1.1
   1.1.2
   1.1.3
1.2 
   1.2.1
   1.2.2
   1.2.3
...


Due-date ordered (aka "Assignments"):
4/1
   1.1.1
   1.1.2
   1.2.1
   1.2.2
4/3
   1.1.3
   1.2.3
Students should be able to toggle between ordering. In due-date ordering, activities should be expanded. In topic ordering, we can retain whatever expand/collapse state was present before. 
In the future, instructors can create any number of assignments (even two with the same due date) and then group activities into an assignment. 
Currently, we wish to encourage a weekly-recurring assignment approach, so we will generate those assignments automatically from the recurring weekly pattern that an instructor creates. 
Activity Time
Time estimates are listed per chapter and per module. Student time is limited, and students need to plan their time and have that be respected. As such, the material may provide an estimate of time to complete each module, perhaps from authors, and/or data from student testers or real students.
Completion & Scores
The content largely consists of activities that students complete – watch a short video, answer questions, interact with a tool, etc. The above figure shows %s indicating activity completion for each module, and each chapter too. Seeing such completion on the TOC provides a sense of satisfaction and is a form of “gamifying”.
The “Completion %" is separate from the "Score" of an activity. A Student will be able to achieve completion no matter when they complete an activity, but their assignment score is a separate metric that only considers the subset of completion attempts that occurred prior to an associated deadline. 
Both need to be visible and transparent to students.
Beyond the TOC
More detailed views will be available. These views may show completion breakdowns by activity type such as lessons, homework, and assessments. They may show scores on scored activities, and values for other metrics, like effort, or like competency per topic.
5. Student preparedness support
Adaptivity
Adaptivity customizes lessons to a student’s progress. The high amount of adaptivity in some educational technology products can be problematic due to: (1) Unfairly causing some students to spend excessive time to complete assignments, (2) Desynching students from classmates, hampering group study/help, (3) Occluding a student’s exercises from their instructor. The courseware strives to achieve benefits of adaptivity while being fair, keeping students in synch, and showing instructors a student’s exercises.
Adaptivity at end-of-module: 
Modules that have lessons should end with a short review lesson consisting of two parts:
Standard:  
* Authored and common to all students. May just take 1-2 min. Lists key concepts, asks a few questions.
Custom:   
* Auto generated and customized based on the student’s lesson performance.
* A simple custom review just lets the student re-answer initially missed questions. More advanced review, perhaps AI driven, is possible.
* For fairness, a student’s customized review should not exceed about 20% of time for the rest of the module, typically less than 15-20 min (ideally less) due to modules being 60-90 min.
   * Instructor may configure custom part to be optional
Adaptivity at end-of-chapter: 
Chapters should end with a review module
Standard:
* Lesson auto-generated from the chapter (likely from module summaries)


Custom:
* Auto-generated lesson(s) based on the student’s chapter performance.
   * May cover prerequisite topics detected to be weak
   * Requires sophisticated underlying knowledge graph and question tagging to enable updating that graph for a student
* Should not exceed 20% of chapter time, ideally less.
   * Instructor may configure custom part to be optional
Corequisite support
A common situation is that a student has taken a high-school math course (e.g., Precalculus) but gets placed into that same course in college based on a placement test. Research suggests better outcomes when placing students directly into the next course (e.g., Calculus) but with just-in-time prerequisite support, often called “corequisite” support (coreq). Often such students take a version of the course that has an extra unit (e.g., a 5-unit “Calculus with support” course versus the base 4-unit “Calculus” course.
The courseware provides direct coreq support by embedding prerequisite activities. Where appropriate, authors start a chapter with a prerequisite module, or a module with a prerequisite lesson. Each student may have a “with prerequisite support” designation, and such students see coreq lessons as normal lessons (perhaps with a special label). Other students see such lessons as optional, and in fact such lessons by default are collapsed.
6. Additional platform capabilities
Feedback
Digital products provide an opportunity for rapid continuous improvement.
The courseware enables users to easily provide feedback throughout every activity (like for a video or question), via conveniently placed buttons or similar throughout, bringing up a simple quick feedback form. The form should allow users to denote an error, which provides escalated response and potentially real-time correction from support (and support should follow up with such users, especially if the error is confirmed, to encourage such error reporting). The form should note the user’s role, in part because instructor feedback also gets escalated attention.
The courseware should auto-analyze feedback (perhaps with AI) to detect common issues, such as activities with excessive error feedback, or trends in feedback across activities (e.g., the system is slow, or trouble clicking on things), and report such issues to support on a weekly or even more frequent basis.
Analysis
The courseware should analyze activity data to detect issues, such as excessive attempts on a particular question, or questions that are frequently answered incorrectly (and not by author design), and report such issues weekly or more. Top 10 lists might also be auto-generated for support, e.g., top 10 incorrectly answered questions, top 10 most-fast-forwarded videos, etc.
The courseware should regularly analyze key performance indicators from users and provide summaries to support, authors, engineers, etc., such as average user sessions per week, average time per session, average number of activities completed per session, un-earnest interaction rate (e.g., rushing through multiple choice, or frequently showing oneself the answer), etc., to potentially detect other areas of improvement.
Discussion Forum - Context Aware
Discussion forums allow students to ask questions of classmates/instructors, and also answer questions, which has its own learning benefits. Discussion forums can also help build a class culture, help students find study partners, and more. Today, forums tend to be disconnected from the content, and LMS forums tend to be clunky as well. The courseware provides a built-in discussion forum. Features:
* Accessed via a simple click from within the content
* If clicked from a particular chapter, module, or activity, only shows the discussion relative to that item
* Also supports class wide discussion
* Might use tags and filtering to show where each post comes from.


Growth culture coaching
As of early 2025, an investment is under development with Mary Murphy of Equity Accelerator to incorporate her growth culture approach into the courseware. This includes: 
* Built-in surveys that students take every few weeks
* Analysis and summary of survey results to instructors, likely via the AI Coach
* Customized mini-lessons provided to instructors on how to improve the growth culture of their class, custom-chosen based on the student survey analysis
* The above process repeats a few times per term. Research shows improved student retention and success, and instructor improvement.
Notes from Users
Students can attach short notes to any activity. These notes are visible only to the student. 
Instructors can attach notes as well, and can set those notes as visible to everyone, to instructors only, or to that instructor’s self only. Notes to students should be constrained to be short, so as not to detract from the content. Suggest that notes may appear at the start or end of a module with no length limit enforced for instructors or attached before any resource with a 144-character limit.
Instructors should be discouraged from extensively annotating content, because authors may change content from term to term. 
The courseware may analyze student and instructor notes, likely using AI, for purposes of improving the content. Ex: If many students attach a note saying, “X is important”, the content itself might be modified to highlight X. Ex: If many instructors note “We do Y differently”, the content might be modified to do Y in that way.
Instructor Per Student Views - Insights
To best help students, instructors need to be able to see what each individual student sees.
In general, an instructor’s access to the courseware should be similar to a student’s access, without having to switch to “student view”. Instead, any items seen only by the instructor should be denoted as such.
Auto-generated questions like in homework or assessments should be re-generatable by an instructor. Thus, every auto-generated question instance should be labeled with a key, such as “AXY478”, from which the question instance can be re-generated.
Adaptively generated content for a particular student, such as custom end-of-module or end-of-chapter content, should be viewable by an instructor. This can be supported by allowing an instructor to “sign in” as any student in the class.
AI 
AI is transforming many things. We expect to use AI in various ways:  
* Point solutions 
* Chatbots: tutor, student coach (including metacognition), instructor coach (including PD), ... 
* Auto-grader:  long-answer responses, series of equations, handwritten equations, hand-drawn plots, spoken English responses, ... 
* Assessment generator: Creating quizzes (of varying length/difficulty), exams. Quality assurance for instructor-created items (accuracy, coverage), ... 
* Content generator: Video/audio/animations from scripts, text, alt-text, exercises, instructor items like syllabus/rubric/worksheets, ... 
* Analyzer: Summarizer of tutor/coach sessions, common mistakes, poll responses, long-answer questions, exam results, class performance, ... 
* Adaptivity 
* Assessing student knowledge, generating just-in-time lessons, offering pre-requisite support, adjusting assessments based on performance, ... 
* Overarching agent 
* Looks across all activities by a student – lessons, exams, discussions, tutor/coach sessions, etc., and providing summary/insights/suggestions in response 
* Looks across entire class's activities and providing  summary/insights/suggestions 
* Looks across all courseware users and detecting trends, assisting in research trials, suggesting/making improvements 


AI Tutor
Students need help, but getting help has challenges, such as unavailability of instructors, slow response from a discussion forum, or students’ fear of being judged. In contrast, an AI tutor can respond 24/7, without students fearing being judged.
The courseware provides a built-in AI tutor, which may exist near the discussion forum. Like the forum, the tutor knows what activity a student is looking at, and answers questions related to that activity’s content. The tutor can also be used independent of an activity, to answer more general questions on the courseware’s subject, or even more general.
The tutor may potentially be influenced by various factors, such as instructor settings (e.g., provide more help), student settings (e.g., be extra cheerful please), and analytics (e.g., a struggling student might get more detailed help).
AI Coach
Students often need help in “being a student”. This might involve planning when to study and how much to study. It might involve motivation. It might involve learning about learning, such as learning how to study, about growth mindset, about stereotype bias, or the benefits of group study or attending office hours. AI coaching is a new direction and one that will surely grow. It is possible that the AI coach and AI tutor might be combined in the future.
AI Transparency
A principle evolving in ethical AI usage is that users should be made aware when info was generated by AI. Such awareness helps them interpret the accuracy of the info, watch out for bias, etc. It can also encourage feedback to report incorrect information from AI. 


As such, the courseware should always strive to make users aware of when info was generated by AI. Such awareness might be achieved by a simple consistent icon or symbol that appears near such info. Clicking on the icon might provide further details on how AI was used for that info. 


7. Instructor professional development


RUANDA – INSERT MARY MURPHY KEY POINTS ON THE FACULTY COACH TOOL DEVELOPMENT AND STUDENT EXPERIENCE SURVEY.


WHAT IS BEING DEVELOPED FOR THE IN-CLASS ACTIVITIES OR LESSON PLANS? WHO IS MANAGING?


The Instructor Resources will provide the materials, data reporting, and frameworks that instructors need to make our visionary curriculum come to life. Using our strengths-based approach, instructors are learning partners whose professional success is directly entwined with their students’ success, supporting their high expectations with high support. 


Instructor support will be provided through a combination of content authored and made available directly to the instructor and platform features and capabilities to deliver that content and simplify their workload and workflow. 
Instructor Only Content
Instructor content may include 
*  Videos: Brief videos that demonstrate how to use the courseware and videos of instructors using the courseware in class (how to teach an active class). 
* Connecting Online Course to Classroom Activities: Plans for hands-on, collaborative activities and discussions, supported by model instructor videos, that provide opportunities for students to solve problems and apply math to real-world scenarios reflecting current, familiar topics that are relevant to them. 
* Instructor Enrichment Videos to Support Individual Needs of Students:  
   * Teachers discuss ways to use AI to create lesson plans, applications, and word problems, allowing them to acknowledge the experiences of a wide range of students.
   * Students of color who have overcome math anxiety and other performance inhibitors talk about the teachers and techniques that helped them break through. These videos could also be used to inspire students.
* Surveys, Small Group Agendas, and In-Class Activity Plans: Our materials help an instructor of any experience level to build stronger relationships with their students in individual, small group, or whole group sessions, establishing trust and familiarity. 
* Additional Resources: PowerPoints, Solutions manuals, Assessment Banks, Projects, Annotations (tips/advice) within the courseware for instructors.


Content for students that will support the instructor and instruction within the class
* Routines for Soliciting Student Feedback: Frequent, brief class surveys solicit ongoing feedback about the concepts students are struggling with and their experiences in the course. This timely data allows instructors to intervene sooner, helping students before they fall through the cracks. 
* A Wealth of Video Resources to Supplement Instructor Tutorials: On-demand micro-videos fill gaps in prerequisite skills, even outside of office hours. When students encounter part of a concept that builds on a prior skill that needs review, they can access video support immediately. 
* Materials That Explicitly Teach Study Skills and Learning Strategies: College students from underrepresented groups sometimes benefit from additional support with academic habits. Our lessons integrate best practices for studying, note-taking, and self-monitoring seamlessly within the content, not as a separate feature.
Instructor Focused Platform Capabilities
* Formative Assessment Data That Streamlines Intervention: The online platform will provide reports to instructors that will help them monitor students. Instructors will know immediately if a student or group of students has disengaged from their work. Instructors will act as coaches, guiding students and providing just-in-time interventions to help them reach proficiency. The platform uses AI to provide instructors with insights into their class (e.g., mistakes last week, suggestions on what to cover). 
* Disaggregated Performance Reports that Monitor Equity: Routine data reports give instructors insight on the formative performance of subgroups of learners based on race, gender, or other characteristics. Using these tools, instructors can draw conclusions about the equity of instructional outcomes and adjust as needed. 
* Teaching Plans and Calendars That Guide Growth-Focused Teaching: Our course materials are structured to remove the guesswork from teaching with a growth mindset. Check-in agendas, data-driven tutorial student groupings, and individualized student intervention plans are embedded with course content. 
* Community of practice – discussion forum built in for connecting with other instructors

* Lessons will be tracked for completion
	Course Instance
	A clone of a courseware subject (e.g., Calculus 1 V2.2) that specifically supports a class. It may have a unique identifying code, such as “Calc1Fall2024UnivXYZ”. It is accessed only by students enrolled in the class section, with a roster provided by the LMS perhaps, or by the instructor. 
  
A courseware instance will be associated with a math platform class section which an instructor may then customize.


Eventually. a courseware instance may combine courseware subjects such as Pre Calc and Calculus
	Course Outcomes
	Describe what students will be able to do or demonstrate as a result of their learning experiences within the course.
	Course
	A "course” is a subject in a university’s course catalog, like “Calculus 1” at Univ XYZ.
	Courseware Catalog
	The list of available courseware subjects from which a courseware instance can be created and associated to a class section. Initially, this will only include Calculus 1 but the courseware catalog would grow over time to support other Math offerings added to the library of offerings.
	Courseware Hierarchy
	Levels in the authored courseware defined for the math platform content to be Chapter > Module > Activity
	Courseware Subject
	An authored courseware intended to cover a common course’s topics, such as Calculus 1. A library of courseware subjects may exist, such as Precalculus, Calculus 1, and Calculus 2 - these will be displayed to instructors for selection in a catalog
	Courseware
	The word “courseware” is a combo of “course” and “software,” alluding to the fact that such supporting materials are increasingly available as software.
A collection of content, resources, activities, and questions authored for a single subject, like “Calculus 1”. This collection will be published and made available to instructors for use in their class sections.
	Due Date
	The date by which an activity must be submitted in order to receive a score in the gradebook.
	Extension
	Ability for an instructor to change the due date for an individual student or for the entire class.
	Homework 
Activity Type
	Type of activity:  Scored, completion only 
* Includes one or more questions, and optionally resources
Homework Delivery Rules/Grading Policy:
* Questions are immediately graded, feedback / hints immediately displayed
* Unlimited retries at the question level; alternative retry question may be presented
* No time limits
	KSAs – Knowledge, Skills and Abilities
	KSA’s are typically defined as the knowledge, skills, and abilities that a person must possess to perform the duties of his or her position.


For use in the Math platform these will be a level below Module Learning Outcomes.  Lessons will have a many-to-many relationship with KSAs. They will be mapped at the question level within the context. KSA’s will provide input into Skills Graph presentations and calculations of proficiency.
	Learning Outcomes
	A brief statement that describes what students are expected to learn by the end of a specific instructional period or from a particular set of resources and questions


For the Math Platform - these will be mapped to the Module Level  
	Lesson 
Activity Type
	Type of activity: Non-scored, completion only 
* Includes one or more resources and optionally questions
* Included questions will have unlimited retries and display available hints and feedback
	Module
	Courseware Hierarchy Node
Second highest node in the hierarchy for Calculus 1; Contains at least one activity
	Proficiency Level
	The level of proficiency a student has achieved in meeting KSAs - may be rolled up to a Module Learning Outcome for presentation to students.
	Proficiency
	Measure of student understanding of a KSA
	Question 
	Prompt with a correct answer (e.g. Multiple Choice, Question in Interactive Video), can include scoring approach: auto or manual, feedback, hints, solution explanation, stem + dynamic variables, points to be awarded for correct answer.
Also called an Assessment Item in Author Guidelines
	Resources
	Courseware content may include text, media, images, audio, links, interactive graphs, etc.
	Scored
	Reflects the quality or level of performance on an activity, assesses the student’s understanding or proficiency against a KSA.
* Relies on a numeric score for tracking in the application gradebook
* Assessments and Homework will be tracked for completion and scored
