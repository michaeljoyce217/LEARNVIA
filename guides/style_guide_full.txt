Learnvia writing style
blank spaces
* In a storyboard or template, use five underscores to indicate the placement of a blank space.
* In question stems, partial calculations, and hints, use this coding where a blank space is needed: \underline{\phantom{XXXXXX}}. 
* For a blank in a fraction, use: \boxed{\phantom{XXXXXX}}.
   * Note: The 6 Xs in the coding yield a blank that is about the width of 5 underscores.
commands
* Avoid the use of the imperative where possible. Commanding language can be off-putting to students.
   * Ex: Instead of saying “Given the graph of a linear function , find the equation. State the equation in slope-intercept form,” you can write “The equation of the graph of the linear function  in slope-intercept form is _____.”
   * Use of the imperative is acceptable when teaching techniques.
   * Ex: 
   * To analyze the behavior of a function using the function’s derivative:
   * Find the derivative of the given function using differentiation rules.
   * Set the derivative equal to zero to identify critical points.
   * Analyze the critical points to determine where the function has local maxima, minima, or points of inflection.
   * Use of the imperative is acceptable in embedded, follow-up, and homework questions.
   * Ex: Find the equation of the line in slope-intercept form that passes through (–6,5) and (3, –1).
contractions
   * Do not use contractions in instructional text. Spell out the full expression.
   * No: Suppose the side length increases over time at a rate of 5 in/hr. What’s the best way to determine how the square’s area is changing over time?
   * Yes: What is the best way to determine how the square’s area is changing over time?
   * Note that the use of possessives is necessary and preferred over “the _____ of the _____.”
   * No: How is the area of the square changing over time?
   * Yes: How is the square’s area changing over time?
   * In particular, avoid the use of the contraction “Let’s”.
   * No: Let’s examine another example that relates three rates of change.
   * Yes: The next example relates three rates of change.


   * No: Now that we’ve found the local extrema and the absolute maximum, let’s look for the absolute minimum.
   * Yes: We have found the local extrema and the absolute maximum. Next we will find the absolute minimum.


definitions
   * Key mathematical terms and their definitions should appear in the framing text of a lesson, between definition tags: <definition> <b>[Key term here]</b> is [definition here].</definition>
   * When a key term is used for the first time, the definition should be written in a standalone statement.
   * The standalone statement should begin with the key term and the verb “is.” 
   * An article (a, an, the) may appear before the key term.
   * The term should be defined in the singular.
   * The definition should explain what something is, rather than what it does.
   * Only one term should be defined in the statement of a definition.
   * Ex: A function is a rule that assigns exactly one output for every input.
examples
   * Use examples frequently for concreteness. 
   * Use “Ex:” to introduce an example. 
   * Ex: “Some fractions yield a repeating decimal. Ex: 1/3 yields 1.333....” 
   * Use the simplest example when introducing new concepts. Avoid complex or abstract examples, especially in early modules. 
   * Ex: Start with , then move to  and  later in the material.
      * Do not use e.g.
      * Use specifically or that is instead of i.e.
introductory clauses
      * Introductory clauses should be avoided. The preferred style is simple sentences with subject-verb-object construction.
explicit structure
      * Use short, direct sentences.
      * Follow subject-verb-object sentence structure. 
      * Avoid introductory clauses.
      * Ex: While we can approximate the area using rectangles, the difference between the actual area and the areas of the rectangles can be significant.
      * Better: We can approximate the area using rectangles. However, the difference between the actual area and the areas of the rectangles can be significant.
pronoun usage
      * Do not use personal pronouns: you, she, he, they, or it.
      * Ex: A student and a teacher sold tickets to a fundraiser. The student said he raised $50 from selling both special and regular tickets. If a special ticket costs $2 and a regular ticket costs $1, how many of each ticket did he sell? 
      * Problem: Who sold the ticket? The student or the teacher? This issue is irrelevant to solving the problem, but the question is still unclear.
      * Better: A student and a teacher sold tickets to a fundraiser. The student raised $50 from selling both special and regular tickets. If a special ticket costs $2 and a regular ticket costs $1, how many of each ticket did the student sell?


punctuation
      * Put commas and periods outside of quotation marks (unless a comma appears in the quotation).
      * Ex: Write “the limit does not exist”.


singular form
      * Write in the singular form whenever possible.
      * No: All quadratic equations have solutions that can be found using the quadratic formula.
      * Yes: Every quadratic equation has a solution that can be found using the quadratic formula.


reading level
      * Aim for an 8th grade reading level.
      * The Hemingway Editor offers an easy way to check reading level.
      * Remember that the audience for the courseware is a diverse population of Calculus I students, particularly those from underserved communities, with fewer opportunities to build strong foundations in math. 


so vs. thus/hence/therefore
      * Do not use thus, hence, or therefore. Use so instead to simplify language for students.


synonyms and homonyms
      * Use one term per concept. Use that term exclusively. 
      * Ensure that terminology is consistent throughout modules and within chapters.
      * Ex: Don’t alternate between “average” and “mean” or “input/output” and “dependent/independent variable.”
      * Do not use the same word for two different concepts.
      * Ex: “The function’s points are plotted. A key point is that the function’s output is never negative.”
vague references
      * Do not use it and they.
      * Ex: In “The expression has one term. It uses two variables,” the word it could refer to the expression or one term. 
      * Better: “The term uses two variables.”
      * Even when not vague, using it can require a reader to refer back and thus increases cognitive load.
      * Exceptions: Sometimes "it" or "they" yields simplicity. 
      * Ex: "Gastroenteritis is common among children. Its symptoms include..." Rewriting that long word yields lengthy text. "Its" is close enough to not increase cognitive load. "Its" also is not vague, since "children" is plural so the "Its" cannot refer to anything but gastroenteritis. 
      * Ex: "A function and its inverse..." Here, "its" obviously refers to the function, and the alternative "A function and the function's inverse..." loses on simplicity.  
      * Avoid This is… and This means…. Also avoid This alone as the subject of a sentence.
      * Ex: “This qualifies as a simple expression.” 
      * Better: “An expression with one term qualifies as a simple expression.”
sentence case in labels and titles
      * Initial capitalize only the first word in labels and titles, except where there are proper nouns; lowercase subsequent words (sentence case without punctuation).
      * No: Figure 1.1. A Function Approaching a Limit
Yes: Figure 1.1. A function approaching a limit
we and you
      * Strive to describe or explain without unnecessary use of the pronoun we. Use we (and the related Let us/Let’s) sparingly, not as a default way of writing.
      * Ex: Rather than, “We define slope as follows,” an author might write, “Slope is….” Otherwise, writing tends to inconsistently switch between descriptions and “we” statements. 
      * Occasional use of we is acceptable when a sentence truly refers to ourselves as people.
      * Ex: “We read ’ aloud as  prime.” 
         * Do not use you.
Math-specific style
absolute value 
         * To express the absolute maximum or minimum of an equation or function, use this wording: _____ has an absolute maximum (or minimum) of _____ at _____.
         * Ex: The function has an absolute maximum of  at .
         * Ex: The function represented (or given) by the graph has an absolute maximum of  at . [not “The graph has an absolute maximum of  at .”]
            * If a function models a specific quantity, use a slight variation: “The area is maximum at..., and the maximum area is....” or “The maximum area is..., which occurs at....”
annotations[a]
            * Do not annotate lines of calculations. The text can run off screen when viewed on a mobile device, frustrating users.
            * If needed, include an opening phrase or sentence before the calculations. This phrase or sentence can help explain the process.
            * Ex: "Using the product rule, we obtain…."
            * Ex: "Differentiate both terms of the expression. Then apply the product rule and simplify.”
coordinate plane/grid
            * Label the positive - and -axes on all graphs.
            * When referring to a specific quadrant, initial capitalize and use Roman numerals.
               * Ex: Quadrant I, Quadrant II, Quadrant III, and Quadrant IV


coordinates
               * Include a space following the comma within an ordered pair.
               * Ex: (14, 20)
               * For ordered pairs that include numbers with 4 digits, do not include a comma within those numbers in addition to the comma followed by a space separating the - and        -coordinates. 
                  * Ex: (4000, 2570)
                  * Avoid using numbers with 4+ digits when possible.
dataset
                  * Use one word, per Merriam Webster (not data set).
decimals
                  * Use a leading zero for decimals < 1. 
                  * Ex: 0.333
definite articles
                  * Remove unnecessary “the” preceding variables. 
                  * Ex: Avoid saying “solve for the .”
equation vs. function
                     * An equation is a mathematical statement.
                     * A function is an operation with an input and an output.
                     * Ex:  is an equation, not a function.
                     *   is a function.
fractions
                        * Do not use mixed numbers.
                        * Align fractions vertically (with the horizontal bar) using \frac or \dfrac.
                        * Ex: 
                           * BUT: In subscripts or superscripts, align the fraction horizontally.
                           * Ex:


             
             


functions and inputs
                           * If replacing  by a value, say “Substitute [the value] for ” rather than calling the value an “input for the variable.”
                           * Avoid plug in and replace. Use substitute instead.
                           * Note that “Move terms from one side of the equation to the other” is mathematically imprecise. Instead say “Add [or subtract] _____ from both sides of the equation.”
hyphenation
                              * Hyphenate the following terms (and other similar terms):
                              * point-slope formula
                              * S-shaped, U-shaped, V-shaped
                              * -axis, -axis
                              * -coordinate, -coordinate
                              * -intercept, -intercept
                              * -value, -value
                              * -variable, -variable


LaTeX coding
                                 * Code all numerals and mathematics using LaTeX.
                                 * Code all units associated with a number in LaTeX using \text{__}.
                                 * A space is needed before the unit.
                                 * Ex: 
                                 * <m>5\text{ cm}</m>
                                 * <m>10\text{ ft}^2</m>
                                 * All punctuation following LaTeX needs to be within the LaTeX. (Otherwise, the punctuation can break onto the next line awkwardly when viewed on a small screen.)
                                 * Ex:
                                 * The equation we previously found, <m>y=2x+1\text{,}</m> represents the tangent line.
                                 * Find the derivative of <m>f(x)=x^2-3\text{.}</m>
                                 * Authors may use an online LaTeX editor, such as https://latexeditor.lagrida.com/, to help with this coding.
                                 * Important reminders:
                                 * Use display style for offset equations, sigma, integrals, and limits.
                                 * Don’t use \dfrac for correct answers in short-answer questions. (This is a limitation of the platform; answers do not display when \dfrac is used.) 
                                 * Use the align environment for a system of equations.
mathematical labels
                                 * Use uppercase and italics for line and point labels. 
                                 * Ex: line , point 
                                    * Use uppercase for angle labels. 
                                    * Ex: angle 
                                       * Use lowercase for labels on the sides of geometric figures. 
                                       * Ex: side 
mathematical symbols (placement in text)
                                          * Do not begin a sentence with a mathematical symbol. Rephrase the sentence or spell out the term for the symbol instead.
                                          * No: f() = 2 + 3 is a line intersecting the -axis at –1.5.
                                          * Yes: The function f() = 2 + 3 is a line that intersects the -axis at –1.5.
measurements
                                             * Include units of measure when appropriate.
                                             * Spell out a unit not preceded by a number.
                                             * Ex: The soccer ball travels several feet after 12 sec.
                                             * The abbreviations for units of measure do not include a period (unless a unit of measure ends a sentence).
                                             * Ex: A veterinarian is monitoring the weight of a newborn elephant. The elephant's weight in kilograms after 𝑡 months is modeled by the function ln. Find the rate at which the elephant’s weight is increasing at months, in kg per month. Then convert your answer to pounds per month. (Note: 1 kg ≈ 2.20462 lb.)
                                                * Abbreviations for units of measure are identical whether singular or plural. (Do not add an s.)
                                                * In a stepped-out mathematical solution, don’t include the units in the calculations until the final answer.
                                                * Ex: 
A hiker is following a Canadian trail at a speed of 1.5 miles per hour. The hiker  crosses into the U.S., where trail markers are in feet per second. Convert the hiker’s speed to feet per second. Round your answer to the nearest tenth. (1 mile = 5280 feet; 1 hour = 3600 seconds.)


        Multiply miles by feet per mile
                Convert hours to seconds 
                
The hiker’s speed is approximately 2.2 ft per sec.


                                                * When a unit is specified in a ratio, use a slash
                                                * Ex: cm3/sec
                                                * Use U.S. customary units vs. imperial units as much as possible.

 multiplication symbols
                                                * Use the \cdot for multiplication, including for scientific notation and dimensions. 
                                                * Ex: 
                                                   * Do not include \cdot in formulas. 
                                                   * Ex: 
                                                      * For evaluating expressions, do not use the \cdot. 
Ex: 
names of mathematical theorems, properties, and postulates vs. rules, formulas, and laws
                                                      * Capitalize all key words in the names of mathematical theorems, properties, and postulates.
                                                      * Ex: “Use the Mean Value Theorem.”
                                                      * Lowercase the names of rules, formulas, and scientific laws.
                                                      * Ex: “Use the rate of change formula.”
                                                      * In titles or labels for graphics, capitalize only the first word in the title/label (except in the case of proper names or the names of theorems, properties, or postulates).
                                                      * Ex: Chain rule
                                                      * Ex: Pythagorean Theorem


  

numbers
                                                      * In mathematical contexts, use numerals for single-digit numbers. 
                                                      * Ex: A person has 1 truck and 12 bicycles.
                                                      * In non-mathematical contexts, spell out single-digit numbers and use numerals for those 10 and over. (Remember that all numerals and mathematics should be coded using LaTeX.)
                                                      * Ex: One helpful strategy is to sketch the function first.
                                                      * Several exceptions follow:
                                                      * Spell out large numbers using words when appropriate.
                                                      * Ex: $1 million/billion/trillion
                                                      * Always use numerals for negative numbers.
                                                      * Ex: The freezer temperature was –30°F.
                                                      * Use numerals and en dashes for number ranges. 
                                                      * Ex: 3–8 (not three-eight or three to eight)
                                                      * In word-problem scenarios, use numerals, not words, for all numbers, including those less than 10.
                                                      * Eliminate the comma in numbers of 4 digits. 
                                                      * Ex: (4389, 578)
                                                      * Use commas in numbers of 5+ digits. (When possible, avoid numbers of more than 4 digits.)
                                                      * If the numbers in a list are 10,000 or over, separate them with semicolons.
                                                      * Ex: (22,305; 14,672; 19,829) 
                                                      * Alternatively, list them with line breaks or in a table.
ordinal numbers
                                                      * Do not superscript ordinal indicators. 
                                                      * Ex: 12th [not 12th]
                                                      * Spell out in non-mathematical contexts. 
                                                      * Ex: “A golfer hits a golf ball toward the fourteenth hole. The ball’s height in feet above the ground after seconds is….”
parentheses
                                                         * Include parentheses in the following types of expressions:
                                                         * Ex: (not 
                                                         * Ex: not 
                                                            * Use outer parentheses for operators like , but not for integrals
                                                               * ln        not ln 
                                                               *   not  
                                                               *   not

                                                                  * Use the mathematical symbol (except when you are introducing the symbol, so the student knows how to pronounce it).
                                                                  * Ex: Do not use the word “pi”. 
point-slope formula
                                                                  * Use  for the point-slope formula.

                                                                     * Alternatively, use \prime to make the prime symbol.
punctuation in mathematical writing
                                                                     * Equations and inequalities are complete sentences and should be punctuated as such in narrative text.
                                                                     * Ex: For any real number , the function is defined by 
                                                                        * Expressions are not complete sentences and should not include end punctuation unless integrated into a complete sentence with surrounding text. 
                                                                        * Ex: What is the derivative expression?

                                                                           * Ex: 1:2 not 1 : 2
since or because with “If . . ., then . . .” statements
                                                                           * In narrative text, use because rather than since to indicate the direct reason behind a specific step or result in a calculation.
                                                                           * Because emphasizes a causal relationship; since implies a temporal element. 
                                                                           *  Avoid using either because OR since paired with then in these structures: 
                                                                           * No: “Since P, then Q”

                                                                           * Yes:  “Because P, Q”
                                                                           * Yes:  “Since P, Q” 
                                                                           * “Because/Since P, then Q” is incorrect because causal language (because/since) is mixed with conditional form (“if ..., then ...”), creating a grammatically and logically inconsistent structure.
substitute
                                                                           * Use substitute rather than plug in or replace.

                                                                           * Include units of measure in headings (rather than with each entry).
                                                                           * No:

                                                                              * Ex: When solving for the maximum area of a rectangular enclosure using 100 meters of fencing, first express the area as
