Should not exceed this box (min 14 pt font). \n<p>Calculating derivatives directly from the limit definition, <m>f'(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) \u2013 f(x)}{h}</m>, can be slow and complex for even simple functions. To make finding derivatives easier, mathematicians have developed rules that allow us to work more efficiently. In this lesson, we\u2019ll focus on the constant rule and learn about the different notations used for derivatives.</p> \n\n<p>There are several ways to write the derivative of a function, and it\u2019s important to recognize and use them. If <m>y = f(x)</m>, the derivative can be written as <m>f'(x)</m>, <m>y'</m>, <m>\\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, or <m>\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)</m>. Each notation is useful in different contexts, such as when working with implicit differentiation which we will learn about in a future module or when emphasizing the variable with respect to which you are differentiating.</p>\n\n<b>Constant Rule</b>\n<p>The constant rule states that the derivative of any constant function is zero. In other words, if <m>f(x) = c</m> where <m>c</m> is a constant, then <m>f'(x) = 0</m>. This can also be written as <m>\\frac{d}{dx} c = 0</m>. This rule reflects the fact that constant functions have no rate of change\u2014their graphs are perfectly flat.</p>\n\nAnimated figure spec\n1: (A) Let\u2019s begin with the constant rule. The derivative of a function is the slope, or the instantaneous rate of change, at any point on the graph. For constant functions, this slope is always the same. \nB) Consider the function f of x equals 2. This graph is a horizontal line at y equals 2.\nC) No matter which point is chosen on the graph, the slope of the tangent is always 0 - the function never changes - the output is always 2.\nD) This means, the derivative of f is 0 everywhere.\n\n1A) Have the box for the constant rule show up (don\u2019t show the rule yet) and draw in the graph of f(x) = 2 (don\u2019t label it yet). \nB) Label the graph of f(x) = 2 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iv91vf-iHPok5IRVowclkWEA1u2p0_e3NBcfrZ-au-k/edit?usp=sharingas such. \nC) Have the wording \u201cslope = 0\u201d come up with the f(x)=2 line.\nD) Have the f\u2019(x)=0 show up on the left under the slope = 0.\n\n2A) Now look at the constant function g of x equals 3. This is also a horizontal line, but at y = 3. \nB) Again, the slope at every point is zero.\nC) The function does not rise or fall, so the rate of change, in other words the derivative, is 0 everywhere.\n\n2A) Draw the graph of y = 3 - label it g(x)=3. \nB) Show the \u201cslope = 0\u201d\nC) Show g\u2019(x)=0.\n\n3A) Last, let\u2019s look at h(x) = 1. The graph of h is a horizontal line at y = 1.\n\n3A) Graph h(x) = 1.\n\nQ: What is the derivative of <m>h(x)=1</m>?\nH: The graph of <m>h(x)=1</m> is a horizontal line. Horizontal lines have slopes of 0. \nH: The derivative of a function gives the slope, or the instantaneous rate of change, at any point on its graph. \nE: 0. The derivative of a function gives the slope, or the instantaneous rate of change, at any point on its graph. Because <m>h(x)</m> is a horizontal line, the slope is always 0 because the function never changes. \n\n\n\nAnimated figure spec\n4: (A) We can generalize our findings to say the derivative of any constant is always 0. \nB) This leads to the constant rule: the derivative of any constant function is always zero. In mathematical terms, the derivative with respect to x of c equals 0.\n\n4A) Display slope - 0 and h\u2019(x) = 0 and highlight the f\u2019(x)=0, h\u2019(x)=0 and g\u2019(x)=0.\nB) Display the constant rule. \n\n5A) The constant rule shows that the derivative of a constant function is always zero, and this result can be expressed using several different notations. B) Prime notation, like f prime of x emphasizes the function\u2019s name and the variable.\nC) The shorthand, y prime, is often used when the function is written as y equal f of x.\nD) For example, if f of x equals 2, we could write its derivative in prime notation as f prime of x equals 0.\n\u000bPAUSE (NEW SCENE)\nE) Leibniz notation, written as d-y over d-x, makes it clear which variable is dependent and which is independent. We say this as the derivative of y with respect to x.\nF) Leibniz notation can also be written as d over d-x of f of x. This way highlights differentiation as an operation applied to a function f of x.\nG) For example, for f(x)=2, the derivative in leibniz notation can be written as d over d-x of 2 equals 0. We would say this as the derivative with respect to x of 2 is 0.\n\n\n5A) Show the derivative notation box and the first table - however only display the left column values and display them as the narrator states them.\nB) Show the first bullet point in the prime box\nC) Show the second bullet in the prime box.\nD) Show the f(x)=2 and the first row of the second table.\nE) display the first bullet for Leibniz\nF) Display the second bullet for leibniz\nG) Show the second row for the f(x) = 2.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Lesson Summary\nIf <m>c</m> is any constant, then <m>\\frac{d}{dx} c = 0</m>.\n \n\n\n\nModule: Basic Rules of Finding Derivatives\nLesson 3.4.2: The Power Rule\nFraming text (just a few sentences. Should not exceed this box (min 14 pt font). \n<p>Another useful rule in calculus is the power rule, which streamlines the process of finding derivatives for functions involving powers of <m>x</m>. Instead of repeatedly applying the limit definition, the power rule offers a direct and efficient method for differentiation for power functions.</p>\n\n<b>Power Rule</b>\n\n<p>The power rule states that if <m>f(x) = x^n</m>, where <m>n</m> is any positive integer, then the derivative is <m>f'(x) = nx^{n-1}</m>. Another way to write this with Leibniz notation is <m>\\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}</m>. \n\nAnimated figure spec (cont)\n2: (E) Now l Previously, we\u2019ve found (F) the derivative of x is 1. (G)The derivative of x squared is 2x. (H) and the derivative of x cubed is 3 x squared. (I) And the derivative with respect to x of x to the fourth is 4 x cubed. \n\n(E) Have the box for the power rule show up. .  \n(F) Have the example show up <m> \\frac{d}{dx} x = 1x^0 = 1 \u2013 if you\u2019re able to animate it in some way that would be awesome. \n(G) Have the example show up  <m> \\frac{d}{dx} x^2 = 2x^1 = 2x </m> \u2013 if you\u2019re able to animate it in some way that would be awesome. \n(H) Have the example show up <m> \\frac{d}{dx} x^3=3x^2 </m> \u2013 if you\u2019re able to animate it in some way that would be awesome. Have the box for x^4 show up when the embedded question pops up but don\u2019t show the f\u2019(x) of it (the 4x^3) until after the embedded question.\n(I) Have the example show up <m> \\frac{d}{dx} x^4 = 4x^3 </m>  \u2013 if you\u2019re able to animate it in some way that would be awesome. \n\n\nQ: Given the pattern in the table, what is </m> \\frac{d}{dx} x^4 </m>?\n* <m> \\frac{d}{dx} x^4 =4x^3</m> E*: The exponent, 4, becomes the coefficient, and the new exponent is one less than the original exponent \n* <m> \\frac{d}{dx} x^4 = x^3</m>. E: Look at the pattern. For example, for the derivative of <m>x^2</m>, the exponent became the coefficient, and the power decreased by one.\n* <m> \\frac{d}{dx} x^4 =4x^4</m> E: The derivative does not keep the same power; the power decreases by one. Look back at the patterns from the previous derivatives. \n* <m> \\frac{d}{dx} x^4 =4x^5</m> E: The derivative exponent decreases by one. Observe how the pattern worked for <m>x^2</m> and <m>x^3</m>. \n\n\nAnimated figure spec (cont)\n3: (J) Notice the exponent in the original function becomes the coefficient in the derivative and the exponent in the derivative is one less than in the original function. (K) This pattern leads us to the power rule: If n is a positive integer, then the derivative of x to the n is n times x to the n-1 power. \n\n\n(J) Animate the coefficients and powers as the narrator states the pattern and display the derivative of x^4.. \n(K) Have the power rule fade in:  If <m>n</m> is a positive integer, then <m> \\dfrac{x}{dx} x^n = n /cdot x ^{n-1}</m>. \n\n\nFollow-up questions (typically 3-7)\nQ1: If <m>f(x)= \u20133</m>, what is <m>f\u2019(x)</m>?\n* f\u2019(x) = 0 E*: The derivative of a constant function is zero because its slope is zero everywhere.  The slope of a constant function never changes.\n* <m>f\u2019(x) = \u20133</m> E: -3 is the value of the function, not its slope.  The graph of <m> f(x) = -3 </m> is a horizontal line.  What is the slope of a horizontal line?  Think about how the slope of a horizontal line behaves. Does it change as the value of <m>x</m> changes? \n* <m>f\u2019(x) = \u20133x</m>  E: This is a function that has <m> -3 </m> as its slope.  Instead, find the slope of the graph of <m>f(x) = -3</m>, which is a horizontal line.\nQ2: What is the power rule formula for finding the derivative of a function in the form <m> f(x)=x^n</m>, where <m>n</m> is a positive integer? \n\n* <m> f\u2019(x)=n \\cdot x^{n-1} </m> E*: To apply the power rule, multiply <m>x</m> by the original exponent and then reduce the power by 1. \n* <m> f(x)=n \\cdot x^n </m> E: Look at the power of <m>x</m>. Does the power of <m>x</m> remain the same after differentiation?\n* <m> f\u2019(x)=n \\cdot x^{n+1} </m> E: When finding the derivative, think about whether the power of <m>x</m> increases or decreases. \n\u000b\nQ3: Find <m> \\frac{d}{dx} x^10</m>. \n\nHint 1: Note the power rule: the derivative of <m> x^n </m> involves multiplying by the exponent and then reducing the power by 1.\n\nHint 2: When differentiating <m>x^10</m>, consider how the exponent 10 affects both the coefficient and the new power of <m>x</m>. \n\nAnswer: <m> \\frac{d}{dx} x^{10} =10x^9</m>\nExplanation: The power rule states if <m>n</m> is any positive integer and <m>f(x)=x^n</m>, then <m>f'(x)=nx^{n-1}</m>.  Applying the rule,  <m> \\dfrac{d}{dx} x^{10} = 10x^{10-1} = 10x^9 </m>.\n\nQ4: Which of the following is true about the slope of any tangent line on the graph of <m>f(x) = x^7 </m>?\n\nChoice*: The slope of a tangent line to <m>f(x)=x^7<m> line will never be negative.\nExplanation: By the power rule, <m>\\dfrac{d}{dx} x^7 = 7x^6 </m>.  Because <m>6 </m> is even, <m>x^6 \\geq 0 </m>. Thus, <m>f\u2019(x) = 7x^6 \\geq 0 <m>.  So, the slope of the tangent line will be either <m>0 </m> or positive, and therefore never negative.\n\nChoice: The slope of every tangent line of <m>f(x) = x^7 </m> will be positive.\nExplanation: By the power rule, <m>f\u2019(x) = 7x^6</m>.  At <m>x=0 </m>, <m>f\u2019(0) = 7 \\cdot 0^6 = 0,</m> which is not a positive number.\n\nChoice: The slope of a tangent line will be negative at a negative <m>x-<m>value and will be positive at a positive <m>x-<m>value.\nExplanation: While the values of <m>f(x) <m> are negative at negative <m>x-</m>values and positive at positive <m>x-</m>values, this is not true of the derivative <m>f\u2019(x) = 7x^6</m>.\n\nChoice: The slope of a tangent line will be positive at a negative <m>x-<m>value and will be negative at a positive <m>x-<m>value.\nExplanation: By the power rule, the derivative is <m>f\u2019(x) = 7x^6 </m>, which gives the slope of the tangent line at any <m>x</m>.\nQ5: This is the graph of the derivative <m>f\u2019(x)<m>.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage description: Graph of f(x) = 6x^5; do not include any numbers on the axes. Only the basic shape should be given.\n\nWhich of the following might be <m>f(x)</m>?\n\nChoice*: <m>f(x)=x^6 <m>\nExplanation: The derivative <m>f\u2019(x) </m> is an odd-degree power function.  So, the function <m>f(x)<m> must be a power function with an even degree.  The only other even-power option for this question is <m>f(x) = x^2 <m>, whose <m>f\u2019(x) = 2x </m> is a line.\n\nChoice: <m>f(x) = x^7</m>\nExplanation: The derivative of <m>f(x) = x^7</m> is <m>f\u2019(x) = 7x^6 </m>, which has an even-degree.  The graph displayed is an odd-degree power function.\n\nChoice: <m>f(x)=x^2</m>\nExplanation: The derivative of <m>f(x) = x^2 </m> is <m>f\u2019(x) = 2x </m>, whose graph is a line.\n\nChoice: <m>f(x)=x^5 </m>\nExplanation: The derivative of <m>f(x) = x^5 </m> is <m>f\u2019(x) = 5x^4 </m>, which has an even-degree. The graph displayed is an odd-degree power function.  \n\n\n\nFollow-up questions (typically 3-7)\nQ6: Which of the following represents the limit definition of the derivative for the constant function <m>f(x) = c</m>?\n\nChoice*: <m>f\u2019(x) = \\lim_{h \\to} \\dfrac{c \u2013 c}{h} </m>\nExplanation: Because <m>f(x) = c </m> is a constant function, <m>f(x+h) = c </m>. The limit definition of the derivative is therefore <m>f\u2019(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\dfrac{c \u2013 c}{h}</m>\n\nChoice: <m>f\u2019(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\dfrac{(c+h) \u2013 c}{h} </m>\nExplanation: Because <m>f(x) = c </m> is a constant function, <m>f(x+h) = c </m>.\n\nChoice: <m>f\u2019(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\dfrac{(c(x+h) \u2013 c}{h} </m>\nExplanation: The constant function <m> f(x) = c </m> will always output <m> c </m>, regardless of the input.  So, <m> f(x+h) = c</m>.\n\nChoice: <m> f\u2019(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\dfrac{c}{h}</m>\nExplanation: The numerator in the limit definition of the derivative is <m>f(x+h) \u2013 f(x) </m>. Because <m>f(x) = c </m> is a constant function, <m>f(x+h) = c </m>.\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Lesson Summary\n\nIf <m>n</m> is any positive integer, then <m>\\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}</m>.\n\n\nModule: Basic Rules of Finding Derivatives\nLesson 3.4.3: Sum, Difference, and Constant Multiple Rules\nFraming text (just a few sentences.

(B) Let\u2019s look at why this rule works. The graph shows the function f of x.  (C) Compare that to the graph of  2 times f. (D) Multiplying f by 2 stretches the graph vertically by a factor of 2. (E) Now let\u2019s focus on the derivatives of both functions at x = 2 by drawing their respective tangent lines. (F) For f at x equals 2, the slope of the tangent line has a rise of 1 and a run of 1 giving a slope of 1. (G) So, the derivative of f at 2 is 1.\n\n\n(A) Show the definition of the constant multiple rule:  If <m>c</m> is constant and <m>f</m> is a differentiable function, then <m> \\frac{d}{dx} (c \\cdot f(x))=c \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} f(x)</m>\n(B) Animate drawing the Graph f(x)=(1/2x)^2 \n(C) Animate drawing the Graph <m>2f(x)</m>\n(D) Show how 2f(x) is the graph of f(x) stretched by 2. \n(E) Show the tangent line being drawn from left to right for each function. \n(F) Draw the slope triangle of a rise of 1/1 on the graph \n(G)  Show that at x = 2, <m>\\dfrac{d}{dx}f(x)=1</m>. \n\n\nQ: Find the slope of the tangent line at <m>x = 2</m> for <m>2f(x)</m>, given that the points <m>(2,2)</m> and <m>(3,4)</m> are on the tangent line.\nHint #1: The slope formula is <m>m = \\frac{y_2 \u2013  y_1}{x_2 \u2013 x_1}</m>.\nHint #2: Substitute the given points <m>(2,2)</m> and <m>(3,4)</m> into the slope formula. \n \nCorrect Answer/Explanation: The slope of the tangent line is 2. <m>m = \\frac{y_2 \u2013 y_1}{x_2 \u2013 x_1} = \\frac{4 \u2013 2}{3 \u2013 2} = 2</m>. \n\n\nAnimated figure spec (cont)\n2: (H) For 2 times f at x equals 2, the slope of the tangent line has a rise of 2 and a run of 1.

A ball is thrown from the ground. The height, h, of the ball in feet at time t seconds can be modeled by the equation h of t equals negative 16 t squared plus 64 t. Find its velocity and acceleration functions. (I) The velocity function is the derivative of the height function. So, v of t equals negative 32 t plus 64. (J) The acceleration function measures how quickly the velocity is changing and is the derivative of the velocity function, or the second derivative of the height function. (K) So, the acceleration is negative 32 feet per second squared. (L) The acceleration of a ball dropping under the force of gravity is constant, which is an important Physics fact.\n\n(H) Have the example problem come up on the screen. A ball is thrown from the ground. The height, <m>h</m>, of the ball in feet at time t seconds can be modeled by the equation <m>h(t)= \u201316t^2+64t</m>.

What is the third derivative? \n\nExplanation: <m> f'\u2019\u2019(x) = 6x \u2013 6 </m>. Because the first derivative is <m> f\u2019(x) = x^3 \u2013 3x^2 + 2x \u2013 1 </m>, two more derivatives are needed to find <m> f\u2019\u2019\u2019(x) </m>.\n<me>\n\\begin{align*}\nf\u2019(x) &= x^3 \u2013 3x^2 + 2x \u2013 1 && \\text{Given first derivative} \\\\\nf'\u2019(x) &= 3x^2 \u2013 6x + 2 && \\text{Second derivative} \\\\\nf'\u2019\u2019(x) &= 6x \u2013 6 && \\text{Third derivative}\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n</me>\nQ5: Let <m> s(t) </m> represent the position of a car, in miles, along a road as a function of time, in hours.
