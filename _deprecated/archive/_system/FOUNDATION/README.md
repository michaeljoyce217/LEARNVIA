# FOUNDATION - Source of Truth

This folder contains the **authoritative source documents** that define Learnvia's core principles and rules.

## What's Here

- `authoring_guide_full.txt` - Complete authoring guidelines
- `style_guide_full.txt` - Complete style guidelines

## Key Principle

These documents are **sacred**. They define the "why" behind every rule in the system. Only modify with explicit team consensus.

## When to Use These

- Understanding the reasoning behind content rules
- Deciding if a rule should be changed or removed
- Creating new rubrics or prompt versions
- Onboarding team members
- Resolving disputes about what the system should do

## What These Enable

All other folders (ACTIVE_CONFIG, DOCUMENTATION, CODE) derive from these source documents. Changes here ripple through the entire system.
