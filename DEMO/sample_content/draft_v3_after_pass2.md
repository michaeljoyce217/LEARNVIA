# Introduction to Slope

## Framing

let us dive into one of the most fundamental concepts in algebra - slope! you will learn how to calculate it, understand what it means, and see how it is used in real life. do not worry if it seems tricky at first, we will break it down step by step. Slope is basically just a way to measure how steep something is. When considering walking up a hill - some hills are really steep and hard to climb, while others are gentle and easy. That's what slope measures in math! (Word count: 89 - too short) Understanding slope is crucial for advanced mathematics, including calculus where derivatives represent instantaneous rates of change. This concept also appears in physics when studying motion and forces, in

### What is Slope?

Slope is a number that describes the steepness and direction of a line. It tells us how much the line goes up or down as we move from left to right.

The slope formula is: $m = ($y2 - $y1$) / ($x2$ - $x1$)

Where ($x1$, $y1$) and ($x2$, $y2$) are two points on the line, and m represents the slope.

### Understanding Slope Values

- **Positive slope**: The line goes up from left to right. This can be thought of as it like climbing uphill.
- **Negative slope**: The line goes down from left to right. it is like going downhill.
- **Zero slope**: The line is horizontal. you are walking on flat ground.
- **Undefined slope**: The line is vertical. Imagine trying to climb a wall!

### Calculating Slope

let us work through an example. The slope can be found between points (2, 3) and (5, 9).

Step 1: Identifyinginginginginging your points
- Point 1: (2, 3) where $x1$ = 2 and $y1$ = 3
- Point 2: (5, 9) where $x2$ = 5 and $y2$ = 9

Step 2: Plug into the formula
$m = (9 - 3)/(5 - 2) $= $\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{6/3}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$ = 2

So the slope is 2, which means for every 1 unit you move right, the line goes up 2 units.

### Real-World Applications

Slope is not just abstract math - it is everywhere! Here are some examples:

1. **Architecture**: Architects use slope to design wheelchair ramps. The ADA requires ramps to have a slope no steeper than 1:12.

2. **Roads**: Road signs show the grade (slope) of steep hills. A 6% grade means the road rises 6 feet for every 100 feet of horizontal distance.

3. **Economics**: In business, we use slope to show rates of change. If a company's profits increase by $5000 for every 100 products sold, that's a slope!

## Examples

### Example 1: Finding Slope from a Graph

Looking at this line on a graph. To find the slope, pick any two points on the line.
let us use (1, 2) and (4, 8).

Using our formula:
slope = (8 - 2) / (4 - 1) = 6 / 3 = 2

It is important to always subtract in the same order!

### Example 2: Negative Slope

The slope can be found between (-2, 5) and (3, -5).

$m = (-5 - 5) / (3 - (-2))
$$m = -10 / 5
$$m = -2

$This negative slope tells us the line is decreasing.

### Example 3: Horizontal Line

What's the slope of a line passing through (2, 4) and (7, 4)?

It can be observed that both points have the same y-coordinate (4).

$m = (4 - 4) / (7 - 2) $= 0 / 5 = 0

A horizontal line always has a slope of 0!

## Practice Problems

These problems provide practice on your own:

1. The slope is calculated between points (1, 3) and (5, 11).
2. A line has a slope of -3 and passes through point (2, 7). What's the y-coordinate when x = 4?
3. you are designing a skateboard ramp. If it needs to rise 3 feet over a horizontal distance of 12 feet, what's the slope?

## Quiz Questions

### Question 1
What is the slope of a line passing through points (3, 7) and (8, 17)?

a) $\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{1/2}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$
b) 2
c) 5
d) 10

**Answer**: b) 2
**Explanation**: Using the slope formula: (17-7)/(8-3) = $\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{10/5}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$ = 2

### Question 2
If a line has a negative slope, which way does it go?

a) Up from left to right
b) Down from left to right
c) it is horizontal
d) it is vertical

**Answer**: b) Down from left to right
**Explanation**: Negative slopes always indicate the line is decreasing as you move from left to right.

### Question 3
The slope is calculated: A hiking trail rises 500 feet over a horizontal distance of 2000 feet.

a) 0.25
b) 2.5
c) 4
d) $\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{1/4}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$

**Answer**: Both a) and d) are correct (0.25 = $\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{1/4}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$)
**Explanation**: Slope = rise/run = $\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{500/2000}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$ = $\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{1/4}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$ or 0.25

### Question 4
What type of slope does a vertical line have?

a) Zero
b) Positive
c) Negative
d) Undefined

**Answer**: d) Undefined
**Explanation**: Vertical lines have undefined slope because you'd be dividing by zero in the slope formula.

### Question 5
You need to build a wheelchair ramp. If the door is 2 feet above ground level and regulations require a slope no steeper than $\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{1/12}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$, what's the minimum horizontal length needed?

a) 6 feet
b) 12 feet
c) 24 feet
d) 36 feet

**Answer**: c) 24 feet
**Explanation**: If slope = rise/run and slope must be at most $\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{1/12}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$, then 2/run ≤ $\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{$\frac{1/12}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$}$, so run ≥ 24 feet.
