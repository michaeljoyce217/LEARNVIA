# DOCUMENTATION - System Explanation

This folder explains **how the system works**. For understanding, research, and learning—not for execution.

## What's Here

- `architecture.md` - The hybrid rubric-generalist system explained
  - 10 competencies, 60/40 agent split, 4-pass workflow, consensus approach

- `rubrics/` - Markdown documentation of all 10 competencies
  - What each rubric evaluates, scoring levels, examples

- `analysis/` - Research, comparisons, and design rationale
  - Why we chose this approach, alternatives considered, recommendations

## Key Principle

This is **reference material**. Read it to understand decisions. Don't execute files from here.

## When to Use This

- Learning how the review system works
- Understanding design decisions and tradeoffs
- Researching rubric definitions and scoring
- Writing technical documentation
- Presenting the system to stakeholders

## Before Changing System Behavior

1. Read relevant docs here to understand current design
2. Check FOUNDATION/ to see if rules exist
3. Modify ACTIVE_CONFIG/ for changes
4. Update these docs to match new behavior
