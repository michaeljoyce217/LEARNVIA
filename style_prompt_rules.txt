# Learnvia Style Guide - AI Prompt Version

## CRITICAL STYLE VIOLATIONS (HIGH SEVERITY)

### Contractions - NEVER ALLOWED
- NO contractions in instructional text (what's → what is)
- Especially avoid "Let's" (use "The next example" instead)
- Possessives ARE allowed (square's area, NOT area of the square)

### Imperative Voice - RESTRICTED USE
FORBIDDEN in general instruction:
- BAD: "Find the equation and state it in slope-intercept form"
- GOOD: "The equation in slope-intercept form is _____"

ALLOWED ONLY FOR:
- Teaching techniques/procedures
- Embedded questions
- Follow-up questions
- Homework questions

## MATHEMATICAL STYLE RULES

### Functions and Equations
- EQUATION: Mathematical statement (y = 2x + 3 is an equation)
- FUNCTION: Operation with input/output (f(x) = 2x + 3 is a function)
- Use "substitute" (never "plug in" or "replace")

### LaTeX Requirements
- Code ALL numerals and math in LaTeX
- Units need space: <m>5\text{ cm}</m>
- Punctuation INSIDE LaTeX: <m>y=2x+1\text{,}</m>
- NO \dfrac in short-answer solutions

### Coordinate Notation
- Space after comma: (14, 20) not (14,20)
- Label positive x- and y-axes on all graphs
- Quadrants: Capitalize and use Roman (Quadrant I, II, III, IV)

## WRITING MECHANICS

### Sentence Structure
- Subject-verb-object preferred
- Avoid introductory clauses
- Start with real subject (not "There is/are")
- 8th grade reading level target

### Word Choice
- Use "so" (not thus/hence/therefore)
- One term per concept (no synonyms)
- Avoid vague "it" and "they"
- No personal pronouns (you, she, he, they)
- Minimal use of "we"

### Formatting
- Serial (Oxford) comma required
- Sentence case in titles (only first word capitalized)
- Leading zero for decimals: 0.333
- No mixed numbers (use improper fractions)

## BLANK SPACES IN QUESTIONS
- Template/storyboard: five underscores _____
- Question stems: \underline{\phantom{XXXXXX}}
- In fractions: \boxed{\phantom{XXXXXX}}

## DEFINITIONS FORMAT
<definition><b>[Term]</b> is [definition].</definition>
- Singular form
- Start with term + "is"
- One term per definition

## UNITS OF MEASURE
- Include when appropriate
- Spell out if not preceded by number
- Abbreviations: no period (5 cm, not 5 cm.)
- No plural 's' on abbreviations
- Use slash for ratios: cm³/sec

## PUNCTUATION
- Commas/periods OUTSIDE quotation marks
- Exception: if comma appears in quotation

## HYPHENATION REQUIRED
- point-slope formula
- S-shaped, U-shaped
- x-axis, y-axis
- x-coordinate, y-coordinate
- x-intercept, y-intercept

## COMMON ERRORS TO FLAG
1. Starting sentences with mathematical symbols
2. Using e.g. instead of "Ex:"
3. Using i.e. instead of "specifically"
4. Four+ digit numbers with commas in coordinates
5. Missing leading zeros in decimals
6. Mixed numbers instead of improper fractions
7. Contractions in any instructional text
