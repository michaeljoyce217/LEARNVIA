# Learnvia Authoring Guidelines - AI Prompt Version

## Target Learner Profile (CRITICAL CONTEXT)
Students studying home alone, low confidence, scared of failing, limited time. NOT well-supported motivated students or instructors.

## Six Core Principles (EVALUATE ALL CONTENT AGAINST THESE)
1. ORGANIZED: Well chunked, scaffolded, aligned with learning outcomes
2. CONCISE: Simplest words/figures to convey concepts (remove, don't add)
3. PRECISE: Accurate words, no synonyms/homonyms, no vague references
4. INTUITIVE: Clearest illustrations and explanations
5. CONCRETE: Student-relevant examples throughout
6. INTERACTIVE: Frequent short activities for engagement

## Module Structure Requirements
COMPLETE MODULE MUST HAVE:
- Framing text: 100-150 words setting up concept
- Lesson content with core teaching
- Examples: Mathematical progression from simple to complex
- Quiz questions: 5-10 learning questions with feedback
- Homework (if applicable)

## Critical Writing Rules
MUST FOLLOW:
- NO SYNONYMS: One term per concept (never alternate average/mean)
- NO HOMONYMS: Different words for different concepts
- SIMPLE SENTENCES: Subject-verb-object structure
- NO VAGUE REFERENCES: Avoid "it", "they", "this"
- ACTIVE VOICE preferred (passive OK when actor unspecified)
- SINGULAR FORM: "Every human has" not "All humans have"
- NO LAZY STARTS: Don't begin with "There is/are"
- USE "Ex:" for examples (not e.g.)
- NO PRONOUNS except "we/us" (sparingly)

## Question Requirements
EMBEDDED QUESTIONS:
- 1-3 per animated figure
- Quick checks (answerable in seconds)
- No calculations required

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS:
- 5-10 questions total
- Start simple, build to harder
- Address common mistakes/misconceptions
- Quick to answer (not homework problems)

MULTIPLE CHOICE:
- Short choices (few words)
- 3 choices default (2-4 acceptable)
- EVERY choice needs explanation
- Distractors target real misconceptions

SHORT ANSWER:
- Single precise answer
- Provide 2+ hints that concretely lead to answer
- Clear formatting instructions

## Common Pedagogical Issues (HIGH SEVERITY)
1. CHUNKS TOO LARGE: Breaking down complex concepts insufficiently
2. POOR SCAFFOLDING: Complex items added too early, big conceptual jumps
3. MISALIGNMENT: Tangents not relevant to learning outcomes
4. MISSING CONCRETE EXAMPLES: Abstract without student connection
5. CALCULATION OVERLOAD: Too much math, not enough concept teaching

## Conciseness Priority
"It's done when nothing more can be removed" - Highest priority after correctness

## Mathematical Correctness
- All formulas must be accurate
- Examples must show correct progression
- Solutions must be mathematically valid
- Notation must be consistent
