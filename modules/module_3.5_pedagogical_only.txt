Product and quotient rules
The product rule
Some functions are written as a product of two functions, such as
h(x) =
              (x^2+1)(5x-3)
. Multiplying the derivatives of each factor does not give the
              correct derivative. The product rule gives a direct way to find the derivative without
              first expanding the expression.
In this lesson, we will practice using the product rule with polynomial functions,
              but this technique also works for other types of functions. This rule will allow us to
              find derivatives more efficiently and will prepare us for more complex problems later.
Product rule
If
f
and
g
are differentiable functions, then the derivative of the
              product is
\dfrac{d}{dx}[f(x) \cdot g(x)] = f'(x) \cdot g(x) + f(x) \cdot g'(x)
Note that
f'(x) \cdot g(x) \ + \
              f(x) \cdot g'(x)
can be written as
f'g + fg'
.
In this lesson, we will use the product rule to compute derivatives
            of products
              of two functions.
