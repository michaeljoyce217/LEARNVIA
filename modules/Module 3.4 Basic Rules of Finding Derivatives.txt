Lesson 3.4.1: The Constant Rule and Derivative Notation 
Framing text (just a few sentences. Should not exceed this box (min 14 pt font). 
<p>Calculating derivatives directly from the limit definition, <m>f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) – f(x)}{h}</m>, can be slow and complex for even simple functions. To make finding derivatives easier, mathematicians have developed rules that allow us to work more efficiently. In this lesson, we’ll focus on the constant rule and learn about the different notations used for derivatives.</p> 

<p>There are several ways to write the derivative of a function, and it’s important to recognize and use them. If <m>y = f(x)</m>, the derivative can be written as <m>f'(x)</m>, <m>y'</m>, <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>, or <m>\frac{d}{dx} f(x)</m>. Each notation is useful in different contexts, such as when working with implicit differentiation which we will learn about in a future module or when emphasizing the variable with respect to which you are differentiating.</p>

<b>Constant Rule</b>
<p>The constant rule states that the derivative of any constant function is zero. In other words, if <m>f(x) = c</m> where <m>c</m> is a constant, then <m>f'(x) = 0</m>. This can also be written as <m>\frac{d}{dx} c = 0</m>. This rule reflects the fact that constant functions have no rate of change—their graphs are perfectly flat.</p>

1: (A) Let’s begin with the constant rule. The derivative of a function is the slope, or the instantaneous rate of change, at any point on the graph. For constant functions, this slope is always the same. 
B) Consider the function f of x equals 2. This graph is a horizontal line at y equals 2.
C) No matter which point is chosen on the graph, the slope of the tangent is always 0 - the function never changes - the output is always 2.
D) This means, the derivative of f is 0 everywhere.

1A) Have the box for the constant rule show up (don’t show the rule yet) and draw in the graph of f(x) = 2 (don’t label it yet). 
B) Label the graph of f(x) = 2 https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Iv91vf-iHPok5IRVowclkWEA1u2p0_e3NBcfrZ-au-k/edit?usp=sharingas such. 
C) Have the wording “slope = 0” come up with the f(x)=2 line.
D) Have the f’(x)=0 show up on the left under the slope = 0.

2A) Now look at the constant function g of x equals 3. This is also a horizontal line, but at y = 3. 
B) Again, the slope at every point is zero.
C) The function does not rise or fall, so the rate of change, in other words the derivative, is 0 everywhere.

2A) Draw the graph of y = 3 - label it g(x)=3. 
B) Show the “slope = 0”
C) Show g’(x)=0.

3A) Last, let’s look at h(x) = 1. The graph of h is a horizontal line at y = 1.

3A) Graph h(x) = 1.

Q: What is the derivative of <m>h(x)=1</m>?
H: The graph of <m>h(x)=1</m> is a horizontal line. Horizontal lines have slopes of 0. 
H: The derivative of a function gives the slope, or the instantaneous rate of change, at any point on its graph. 
E: 0. The derivative of a function gives the slope, or the instantaneous rate of change, at any point on its graph. Because <m>h(x)</m> is a horizontal line, the slope is always 0 because the function never changes. 



Animated figure spec
4: (A) We can generalize our findings to say the derivative of any constant is always 0. 
B) This leads to the constant rule: the derivative of any constant function is always zero. In mathematical terms, the derivative with respect to x of c equals 0.

4A) Display slope - 0 and h’(x) = 0 and highlight the f’(x)=0, h’(x)=0 and g’(x)=0.
B) Display the constant rule. 

5A) The constant rule shows that the derivative of a constant function is always zero, and this result can be expressed using several different notations. B) Prime notation, like f prime of x emphasizes the function’s name and the variable.
C) The shorthand, y prime, is often used when the function is written as y equal f of x.
D) For example, if f of x equals 2, we could write its derivative in prime notation as f prime of x equals 0.
PAUSE (NEW SCENE)
E) Leibniz notation, written as d-y over d-x, makes it clear which variable is dependent and which is independent. We say this as the derivative of y with respect to x.
F) Leibniz notation can also be written as d over d-x of f of x. This way highlights differentiation as an operation applied to a function f of x.
G) For example, for f(x)=2, the derivative in leibniz notation can be written as d over d-x of 2 equals 0. We would say this as the derivative with respect to x of 2 is 0.


5A) Show the derivative notation box and the first table - however only display the left column values and display them as the narrator states them.
B) Show the first bullet point in the prime box
C) Show the second bullet in the prime box.
D) Show the f(x)=2 and the first row of the second table.
E) display the first bullet for Leibniz
F) Display the second bullet for leibniz
G) Show the second row for the f(x) = 2.

Lesson 3.4.2: The Power Rule
Framing text (just a few sentences. Should not exceed this box (min 14 pt font). 
<p>Another useful rule in calculus is the power rule, which streamlines the process of finding derivatives for functions involving powers of <m>x</m>. Instead of repeatedly applying the limit definition, the power rule offers a direct and efficient method for differentiation for power functions.</p>

<b>Power Rule</b>

<p>The power rule states that if <m>f(x) = x^n</m>, where <m>n</m> is any positive integer, then the derivative is <m>f'(x) = nx^{n-1}</m>. Another way to write this with Leibniz notation is <m>\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}</m>. 

Animated figure spec (cont)
2: (E) Now l Previously, we’ve found (F) the derivative of x is 1. (G)The derivative of x squared is 2x. (H) and the derivative of x cubed is 3 x squared. (I) And the derivative with respect to x of x to the fourth is 4 x cubed. 

(E) Have the box for the power rule show up. .  
(F) Have the example show up <m> \frac{d}{dx} x = 1x^0 = 1 – if you’re able to animate it in some way that would be awesome. 
(G) Have the example show up  <m> \frac{d}{dx} x^2 = 2x^1 = 2x </m> – if you’re able to animate it in some way that would be awesome. 
(H) Have the example show up <m> \frac{d}{dx} x^3=3x^2 </m> – if you’re able to animate it in some way that would be awesome. Have the box for x^4 show up when the embedded question pops up but don’t show the f’(x) of it (the 4x^3) until after the embedded question.
(I) Have the example show up <m> \frac{d}{dx} x^4 = 4x^3 </m>  – if you’re able to animate it in some way that would be awesome. 


Q: Given the pattern in the table, what is </m> \frac{d}{dx} x^4 </m>?
* <m> \frac{d}{dx} x^4 =4x^3</m> E*: The exponent, 4, becomes the coefficient, and the new exponent is one less than the original exponent 
* <m> \frac{d}{dx} x^4 = x^3</m>. E: Look at the pattern. For example, for the derivative of <m>x^2</m>, the exponent became the coefficient, and the power decreased by one.
* <m> \frac{d}{dx} x^4 =4x^4</m> E: The derivative does not keep the same power; the power decreases by one. Look back at the patterns from the previous derivatives. 
* <m> \frac{d}{dx} x^4 =4x^5</m> E: The derivative exponent decreases by one. Observe how the pattern worked for <m>x^2</m> and <m>x^3</m>. 


Animated figure spec (cont)
3: (J) Notice the exponent in the original function becomes the coefficient in the derivative and the exponent in the derivative is one less than in the original function. (K) This pattern leads us to the power rule: If n is a positive integer, then the derivative of x to the n is n times x to the n-1 power. 


(J) Animate the coefficients and powers as the narrator states the pattern and display the derivative of x^4.. 
(K) Have the power rule fade in:  If <m>n</m> is a positive integer, then <m> \dfrac{x}{dx} x^n = n /cdot x ^{n-1}</m>. 


Follow-up questions (typically 3-7)
Q1: If <m>f(x)= –3</m>, what is <m>f’(x)</m>?
* f’(x) = 0 E*: The derivative of a constant function is zero because its slope is zero everywhere.  The slope of a constant function never changes.
* <m>f’(x) = –3</m> E: -3 is the value of the function, not its slope.  The graph of <m> f(x) = -3 </m> is a horizontal line.  What is the slope of a horizontal line?  Think about how the slope of a horizontal line behaves. Does it change as the value of <m>x</m> changes? 
* <m>f’(x) = –3x</m>  E: This is a function that has <m> -3 </m> as its slope.  Instead, find the slope of the graph of <m>f(x) = -3</m>, which is a horizontal line.
Q2: What is the power rule formula for finding the derivative of a function in the form <m> f(x)=x^n</m>, where <m>n</m> is a positive integer? 

* <m> f’(x)=n \cdot x^{n-1} </m> E*: To apply the power rule, multiply <m>x</m> by the original exponent and then reduce the power by 1. 
* <m> f(x)=n \cdot x^n </m> E: Look at the power of <m>x</m>. Does the power of <m>x</m> remain the same after differentiation?
* <m> f’(x)=n \cdot x^{n+1} </m> E: When finding the derivative, think about whether the power of <m>x</m> increases or decreases. 

Q3: Find <m> \frac{d}{dx} x^10</m>. 

Hint 1: Note the power rule: the derivative of <m> x^n </m> involves multiplying by the exponent and then reducing the power by 1.

Hint 2: When differentiating <m>x^10</m>, consider how the exponent 10 affects both the coefficient and the new power of <m>x</m>. 

Answer: <m> \frac{d}{dx} x^{10} =10x^9</m>
Explanation: The power rule states if <m>n</m> is any positive integer and <m>f(x)=x^n</m>, then <m>f'(x)=nx^{n-1}</m>.  Applying the rule,  <m> \dfrac{d}{dx} x^{10} = 10x^{10-1} = 10x^9 </m>.

Q4: Which of the following is true about the slope of any tangent line on the graph of <m>f(x) = x^7 </m>?

Choice*: The slope of a tangent line to <m>f(x)=x^7<m> line will never be negative.
Explanation: By the power rule, <m>\dfrac{d}{dx} x^7 = 7x^6 </m>.  Because <m>6 </m> is even, <m>x^6 \geq 0 </m>. Thus, <m>f’(x) = 7x^6 \geq 0 <m>.  So, the slope of the tangent line will be either <m>0 </m> or positive, and therefore never negative.

Choice: The slope of every tangent line of <m>f(x) = x^7 </m> will be positive.
Explanation: By the power rule, <m>f’(x) = 7x^6</m>.  At <m>x=0 </m>, <m>f’(0) = 7 \cdot 0^6 = 0,</m> which is not a positive number.

Choice: The slope of a tangent line will be negative at a negative <m>x-<m>value and will be positive at a positive <m>x-<m>value.
Explanation: While the values of <m>f(x) <m> are negative at negative <m>x-</m>values and positive at positive <m>x-</m>values, this is not true of the derivative <m>f’(x) = 7x^6</m>.

Choice: The slope of a tangent line will be positive at a negative <m>x-<m>value and will be negative at a positive <m>x-<m>value.
Explanation: By the power rule, the derivative is <m>f’(x) = 7x^6 </m>, which gives the slope of the tangent line at any <m>x</m>.
Q5: This is the graph of the derivative <m>f’(x)<m>.








Image description: Graph of f(x) = 6x^5; do not include any numbers on the axes. Only the basic shape should be given.

Which of the following might be <m>f(x)</m>?

Choice*: <m>f(x)=x^6 <m>
Explanation: The derivative <m>f’(x) </m> is an odd-degree power function.  So, the function <m>f(x)<m> must be a power function with an even degree.  The only other even-power option for this question is <m>f(x) = x^2 <m>, whose <m>f’(x) = 2x </m> is a line.

Choice: <m>f(x) = x^7</m>
Explanation: The derivative of <m>f(x) = x^7</m> is <m>f’(x) = 7x^6 </m>, which has an even-degree.  The graph displayed is an odd-degree power function.

Choice: <m>f(x)=x^2</m>
Explanation: The derivative of <m>f(x) = x^2 </m> is <m>f’(x) = 2x </m>, whose graph is a line.

Choice: <m>f(x)=x^5 </m>
Explanation: The derivative of <m>f(x) = x^5 </m> is <m>f’(x) = 5x^4 </m>, which has an even-degree. The graph displayed is an odd-degree power function.  



Follow-up questions (typically 3-7)
Q6: Which of the following represents the limit definition of the derivative for the constant function <m>f(x) = c</m>?

Choice*: <m>f’(x) = \lim_{h \to} \dfrac{c – c}{h} </m>
Explanation: Because <m>f(x) = c </m> is a constant function, <m>f(x+h) = c </m>. The limit definition of the derivative is therefore <m>f’(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{c – c}{h}</m>

Choice: <m>f’(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{(c+h) – c}{h} </m>
Explanation: Because <m>f(x) = c </m> is a constant function, <m>f(x+h) = c </m>.

Choice: <m>f’(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{(c(x+h) – c}{h} </m>
Explanation: The constant function <m> f(x) = c </m> will always output <m> c </m>, regardless of the input.  So, <m> f(x+h) = c</m>.

Choice: <m> f’(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{c}{h}</m>
Explanation: The numerator in the limit definition of the derivative is <m>f(x+h) – f(x) </m>. Because <m>f(x) = c </m> is a constant function, <m>f(x+h) = c </m>.

Animated figure spec
1: (A) The constant rule states that if c is a constant and f is a differentiable function, then the derivative with respect to x is c times the derivative of f of x. (B) Let’s look at why this rule works. The graph shows the function f of x.  (C) Compare that to the graph of  2 times f. (D) Multiplying f by 2 stretches the graph vertically by a factor of 2. (E) Now let’s focus on the derivatives of both functions at x = 2 by drawing their respective tangent lines. (F) For f at x equals 2, the slope of the tangent line has a rise of 1 and a run of 1 giving a slope of 1. (G) So, the derivative of f at 2 is 1.


(A) Show the definition of the constant multiple rule:  If <m>c</m> is constant and <m>f</m> is a differentiable function, then <m> \frac{d}{dx} (c \cdot f(x))=c \cdot \frac{d}{dx} f(x)</m>
(B) Animate drawing the Graph f(x)=(1/2x)^2 
(C) Animate drawing the Graph <m>2f(x)</m>
(D) Show how 2f(x) is the graph of f(x) stretched by 2. 
(E) Show the tangent line being drawn from left to right for each function. 
(F) Draw the slope triangle of a rise of 1/1 on the graph 
(G)  Show that at x = 2, <m>\dfrac{d}{dx}f(x)=1</m>. 


Q: Find the slope of the tangent line at <m>x = 2</m> for <m>2f(x)</m>, given that the points <m>(2,2)</m> and <m>(3,4)</m> are on the tangent line.
Hint #1: The slope formula is <m>m = \frac{y_2 –  y_1}{x_2 – x_1}</m>.
Hint #2: Substitute the given points <m>(2,2)</m> and <m>(3,4)</m> into the slope formula. 
 
Correct Answer/Explanation: The slope of the tangent line is 2. <m>m = \frac{y_2 – y_1}{x_2 – x_1} = \frac{4 – 2}{3 – 2} = 2</m>. 


Animated figure spec (cont)
2: (H) For 2 times f at x equals 2, the slope of the tangent line has a rise of 2 and a run of 1. (I) So, the derivative of 2 times f equals 2. (J) Comparing these slopes, the derivative of 2 times f is twice the derivative of f at the same point. (K) This example illustrates the constant multiple rule – the derivative of 2 times f is 2 times the derivative of f.

(H) Draw the slope triangle of a rise of 2/1 on the graph of the tangent line for 2f(x) 
(I) <m> \frac{d}{dx} (2f(x))=2</m> at <m>x = 2</m>
(J) Animate the 1 and the 2 for the derivative equations and next to the d/dx 2f(x) = 2 put = 2(1) to illustrate it’s twice the value of f(x) at x = 2. <m>\dfrac{d}{dx} 2 \cdot f(x) = 2 = 2 /cdot 1</m>
(K) Fade in or animate: <m>\dfrac{d}{dx} 2 \cdot f(x) = 2 \dfrac{d}{dx} f(x) </m>.

Q: Assume <m>g(x)</m> is a differentiable function and <m>\frac{d}{dx} g(x) = – 3x </m>. Find <m> \frac{d}{dx} (2 \cdot g(x))</m>.  
Hint #1: We are looking to find the derivative of the function <m> g(x) </m> multiplied by a constant. Recall the Constant Multiple Rule for Derivatives. 
Hint #2: The Constant Multiple Rule states that for a constant <m>c</m> and a differentiable function <m>f(x)</m>, <m>\frac{d}{dx}(c \cdot f(x)) = c \cdot \frac{d}{dx}f(x)</m>. 
 
Correct Answer/Explanation: <m>\frac{d}{dx} (2 \cdot g(x)) = -6x</m>.  
\begin{align} \frac{d}{dx}[2 \cdot g(x)] &= 2 \cdot \frac{d}{dx}g(x) && \text{Apply the Constant Multiple Rule.} \\ &= 2 \cdot (–3x) && \text{Substitute the given derivative of } g(x). \\ &= –6x && \text{Simplify}\\ \end{align}

3: (L) Now let’s explore two additional rules for calculating derivatives: the Sum and Difference Rules (M) If f and g are both differentiable, then the derivative of f plus g is equal to the derivative of f plus the derivative of g (N) And, the derivative of f minus g is equal to the derivative of f minus the derivative of g (O) Let’s apply these rules to find the derivative of x squared plus 5x minus 3 (P) First, apply the sum and difference rule to separate the terms. (Q) Now differentiate each term. The derivative of x^2 is 2x, the derivative of 5x is 5 and the derivative of 3 is 0. (R) Therefore, the derivative is 2x plus 5. 


(L) Have the sum and difference rule box show up on the screen. 
(M) Fade in the sum rule: If <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are both differentiable, then <m> \frac{d}{dx} (f(x)+g(x))= \frac{d}{dx} f(x)+ \frac{d}{dx} g(x) </m>
(N) Fade in the difference rule: <m> \frac{d}{dx} (f(x) – g(x))= \frac{d}{dx} f(x)- \frac{d}{dx} g(x) </m> 
(O) Have the example problem display: <m>\dfrac{d}{dx} (x^2+2x – 3)</m>
(P) Animate the separation of each term. <m> \frac{d}{dx} x^2 + frac{d}{dx} 5x – frac{d}{dx} 3

Q3: Find <m>f’(x) <m> when <m> f(x) = 6x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1 <m>.

Hint 2: To compute the derivative of a term like <m> \dfrac{d}{dx} (6x^3) </m>, use the constant multiple rule and power rule: <m> \dfrac{d}{dx} (6x^3) = 6 \dfrac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 6 \cdot(3x^2) </m>.

Explanation: <m>f’(x) = 18x^2 – 4x + 5 </m>.  Using the sum and difference rules, we can break up the derivative polynomial by its individual terms and then apply the constant multiple and power rules:

<me>
\begin{align*}
f’(x) &= \dfrac{d}{dx} \left(6x^3 - 2x^2 + 5x - 1 \right) \\

&= 6 \dfrac{d}{dx}(x^3)  – 2\dfrac{d}{dx}(x^2) + 5 \dfrac{d}{dx}(x) - \dfrac{d}{dx}(1) && \text{Constant multiple rule}\\
&= 6 \cdot (3x^2) - 2 \cdot (2x) + 5 \cdot (1) - 0 && \text{Power rule and constant rule} \\
&= 18x^2 - 4x + 5 && \text{Simplify} \\

Q5: Find the derivative of <m> f(x) = x^3-3x^2-x+5 </m>.

Explanation: Both functions have the same derivative: <m>6x + 5</m>.  The constant term (2 or –9) makes no difference to the derivative because the derivative of all constant terms is zero.
Choice: <m> g(x) = –3x^2 + 5x + 2 </m>

Choice: <m> g(x) = –3x^2 – 5x – 5 </m>

Choice*: The slope of the tangent line is <m> f’(3) </m>.
Explanation: The slope of the tangent line is exactly the instantaneous rate of change of <m>f</m>, which is the derivative of <m> f </m> evaluated at <m> x = 3 </m>.

Choice: The slope of the tangent line is <m> f(3) </m>.
Explanation: The slope of the tangent line is directly related to the derivative of the function, not the function itself.

Choice: The tangent line will go through the point <m>(3,f’(3))</m>.
Explanation: The tangent line goes through <m> (3,f(3)) </m>, which is different than <m> (3,f’(3)) </m>.

Choice: The equation of the tangent line at <m> x = 3 </m> is given by <m> y = f(3)(x –3) + f’(3) </m>.
Explanation: This answer choice has the role of <m> f(3) </m> and <m> f’(3) </m> swapped.
Q4: Given the function <m>f(x)=x^3 –5x+10</m>, what is the tangent line’s equation at the point <m>(1,6)</m>?

Hint 1: The equation of a tangent line to a curve <m>y=f(x)</m> at a point <m>(a,f(a))</m> is given by: <m>y=f’(a)(x – a)+f(a)</m>. 

Hint 2: Calculate <m>f’(1)</m> to determine the tangent line’s slope at <m>x=1</m>. 

Answer: <m>y = -2x + 8</m> 
Explanation: The slope of the tangent line, <m> f’(1) </m> can be computed as follows:

<me> 
\begin{align*} 
f(x) &= x^3 - 5x + 10  &&\\ 
f'(x) &= 3x^2 - 5 && \text{Differentiate} \\ 
f'(1) &= 3(1)^2 - 5 && \text{Substitute <m> x = 1 </m>} \\ 
&= -2 && \text{Simplify} \\ 
\end{align*} 
</me> 

Since <m>f(1) = 6</m>, the equation of the tangent line is given by <m> y = f’(1)(x-1) + f(1) = -2(x-1) + 6 = -2x + 8</m>.

Q5: Given the function <m>f(x) = 2x^3 - x^2 + 6x - 1</m>, find the equation of the tangent line at <m> x = -1 </m>.

Hint 1: Calculate <m>f’(-1)</m> to determine the tangent line’s slope at <m>x=-1</m>.

Hint 2: The function value <m> f(-1) </m> will also be needed in the computation.  Find this by substituting <m> x = -1 </m> into <m>f(x) = 2x^3 - x^2 + 6x - 1</m>.

Explanation: <m> y = 14(x+1) - 10</m>

The slope of the tangent line, <m> f’(1) </m> can be computed as follows:

<me> 
\begin{align*} 
f(x) &= 2x^3 - x^2 + 6x - 1  &&\\ 
f'(x) &= 6x^2 - 2x + 6 && \text{Differentiate} \\ 
f'(1) &= 6(-1)^2 - 2(-1) + 6 && \text{Substitute <m> x = -1 </m>} \\ 
&= 14 && \text{Simplify} \\ 
\end{align*} 
</me> 

Next, we compute the function value <m>f(-1) = 2(-1)^3 - (-1)^2 + 6(-1) - 1 = -10 </m>.  Thus, the equation of the tangent line is <m> y = f’(-1)(x - (-1)) + f(-1) = 14(x+1) - 10 = 14x + 4 </m>


Follow-up questions (typically 3-7)
Q6: Find the equation of the line that goes through the point <m> (2,1) </m> and is parallel to the tangent line of <m> f(x) = 2x^2 + 3x – 4 </m> at <m> x = –\frac{3}{2} </m>.
Hint 1: Parallel lines have the same slope.
Hint 2: The slope of the desired line and the tangent line are the same.  So, the slope of both lines will be <m> f’\left(–\frac{3}{2}\right) </m>.
Explanation: The equation of the line is <m> y = –3(x – 2) + 1 </m>. Computing the derivative of <m> f </m> yields <m> f’(x) = 4x + 3 </m>.  So, <m> f’\left(–\frac{3}{2}\right) = 4 \left(–\frac{3}{2}\right) + 3 = –6 + 3 = –3.<m>. Thus, the slope of the tangent line is <m> –3 </m>.  The desired line is parallel to the tangent line and therefore has the same slope.  Since the desired line goes through <m>(2,1)</m>, its equation is given by <m> y = –3(x-2) + 1 </m>.

Q7: What is the <m>y</m>-intercept of the tangent line of <m> f(x) = 3x^2 – 3x+1 </m> at <m> x = 2 </m>? Write the answer as a coordinate point.

Hint 1: First, find the equation of the tangent line.  The <m>y</m>-coordinate can be found by substituting <m>x = 0 </m> into the equation of the tangent line.

Hint 2: The derivative of <m> f </m> is <m> f’(x) = 6x – 3 </m>.  The equation of the tangent line is <m> y = f’(2)(x – 2)+f(2) </m>.  After this is computed, substituting in <m> x = 0 </m> will yield the <m> y</m>-coordinate of the <m>y</m>-intercept.

Explanation: The <m>y</m>-intercept is <m>(0, –9)</m>. The equation of the tangent line can be found as follows:
<me>
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= 3x^2 – 3x + 1 \\
f(2) &= 3(2)^2 – 3(2) + 1 && \text{Substitute <m> x = 2 </m>}\\
&= 7 && \text{Simplify} \\
f'(x) &= 6x – 3 && \text{Compute derivative} \\
f'(2) &= 6(2) – 3 && \text{Substitute <m> x = 2 </m>} \\
&= 9 && \text{Simplify}\\
y &= f’(2)(x – 2) + f(2) && \text{Equation of tangent line at m> x = 2 </m>} \\
&= 9(x – 2) + 7 && \text{Substitute <m> f’(2) </m> and <m>f(2) </m>} \\
&= 9x – 9 && \text{Simplify}\\
\end{align*}
</me>

As the tangent line <m> y = 9x – 9 </m> is written in slope-intercept form, the <m>y</m>-intercept occurs at <m> (0, –9) </m>.

Follow-up questions (typically 3-7)`
Q6: If a polynomial function <m> f(x) </m> has as its third derivative <m>f’’’(x) = 0 </m> for all <m>x</m>, what must be true about <m>f(x)</m>?

Choice*: <m> f </m> is a polynomial function of degree 2 or less.
Explanation: Taking three derivatives of any polynomial of the form <m> f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c </m> yields the following:
<me>
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= 2ax + b \\
f'’(x) &= 2a \\
f'’’(x) &= 0 \\
\end{align*}
</me>
So any polynomial of degree 2 or less will have <m>f’’’(x) = 0</m>.

Choice: <m> f </m> is a polynomial function of degree 3 or less.
Explanation: The degree 3 polynomial <m> f(x) = x^3 </m> has the following derivatives:
<me>
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= 3x^2 \\
f'’(x) &= 6x \\
f'’’(x) &= 6 \\
\end{align*}
</me>
Since <m> f’’’(x) </m> is not a zero function, then it is not true that all polynomial functions of degree 3 or less have <m> f’’’(x) = 0 </m>.


Choice: <m> f </m> is a linear function.
Explanation: While all linear functions have third derivatives equal to zero (in fact, second derivatives equal to <m> 0 </m> as well), so do quadratic functions.  For example, if <m> f(x) = x^2 </m>, then
<me>
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= 2x \\
f'’(x) &= 2 \\
f'’’(x) &= 0 \\
\end{align*}
</me>.
So, it is not necessarily true that <m> f </m> must be a linear function.

Choice: <m> f </m> is a constant function.
Explanation: While all constant functions have third derivatives equal to zero (in fact, first and second derivatives equal to <m> 0 </m>), so do quadratic functions.  For example, if <m> f(x) = x^2 </m>, then
<me>
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= 2x \\
f'’(x) &= 2 \\
f'’’(x) &= 0 \\
\end{align*}
</me>.
So, it is not necessarily true that <m> f </m> must be a constant function.
Q7: Which of the following functions has <m> f’’(x) = 12x</m> as its second derivative?

Choice*: <m> f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x – 1 </m>
Explanation: Taking two derivatives yields 
<me>
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= 6x^2 + 5 \\
f'’(x) &= 12x \\
\end{align*}
</me>

Choice: <m> f(x) = 2x^3 + 5x^2 – 1 </m>
Explanation: Taking two derivatives yields
<me>
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= 6x^2 + 10x \\
f'’(x) &= 12 x + 10\\
\end{align*}
</me>
This does not produce the desired second derivative of <m> f’’(x) = 12x</m>.

Choice: <m> f(x) = 6x^2 + 5x – 1 </m>
Explanation: Taking two derivatives yields
<me>
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= 12x + 5 \\
f'’(x) &= 12\\
\end{align*}
</me>
This does not produce the desired second derivative of <m> f’’(x) = 12x</m>.


Choice: <m> f(x) = 6x^2 + 5 </m>
Explanation: Taking two derivatives yields
<me>
\begin{align*}
f'(x) &= 12x \\
f'’(x) &= 12\\
\end{align*}
</me>
This does not produce the desired second derivative of <m> f’’(x) = 12x</m>.

End of Lesson Summary
Higher-order derivatives involve repeated differentiation, with each derivative building upon the previous one (2nd derivative is the derivative of the 1st, 3rd derivative is the derivative of the 2nd, etc.) 
Two notation systems exist for higher derivatives: 
Standard notation: <m>f''(x)</m>, <m>f'''(x)</m>, <m>f^{(n)}(x)</m> 
Leibniz notation: <m>\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}</m>, <m>\frac{d^3y}{dx^3}</m>, <m>\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}</m> 
In physics, higher derivatives of position describe motion: 
Position <m>s(t)</m> → Velocity <m>s'(t)</m> → Acceleration <m>s''(t)</m>.
